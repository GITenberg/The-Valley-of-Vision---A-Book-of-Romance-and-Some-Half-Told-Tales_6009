    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you choose such a title as <i>The Valley of Vision</i> for your
      book,&rdquo; said my friend; &ldquo;do you mean that one can see farther from the
      valley than from the mountain-top?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question set me thinking, as every honest question ought to do. Here
      is the result of my thoughts, which you will take for what it is worth, if
      you care to read the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mountain-top is the place of outlook over the earth and the sea. But
      it is in the valley of suffering, endurance, and self-sacrifice that the
      deepest visions of the meaning of life come to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I take the outcome of this Twentieth Century War as a victory over the mad
      illusion of world-dominion which the Germans saw from the peak of their
      military power in 1914. The united force of the Allies has grown, through
      valley-visions of right and justice and human kindness, into an
      irresistible might before which the German &ldquo;will to power&rdquo; has gone down
      in ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some Half-Told Tales in the volume&mdash;fables, fantasies&mdash;mere
      sketches, grave and gay, on the margin of the book of life,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;Where more is meant than meets the ear.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Dreams have a part in most of the longer stories. That is because I
      believe dreams have a part in real life. Some of them we remember as
      vividly as any actual experience. These belong to the imperfect sleep. But
      others we do not remember, because they are given to us in that perfect
      sleep in which the soul is liberated, and goes visiting. Yet sometimes we
      get a trace of them, by a happy chance, and often their influence remains
      with us in that spiritual refreshment with which we awake from profound
      slumber. This is the meaning of that verse in the old psalm: &ldquo;He giveth to
      His beloved in sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The final story in the book was written before the War of 1914 began, and
      it has to do with the Light of the World, leading us through conflict and
      suffering towards Peace.

    <h2>
      A REMEMBERED DREAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is the story of a dream that came to me some five-and-twenty years
      ago. It is as vivid in memory as anything that I have ever seen in the
      outward world, as distinct as any experience through which I have ever
      passed. Not all dreams are thus remembered. But some are. In the records
      of the mind, where the inner chronicle of life is written, they are
      intensely clear and veridical. I shall try to tell the story of this dream
      with an absolute faithfulness, adding nothing and leaving nothing out, but
      writing the narrative just as if the thing were real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was. Who can say?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a journey, of the beginning and end of which I know
      nothing, I had come to a great city, whose name, if it was ever told me, I
      cannot recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evidently a very ancient place. The dwelling-houses and larger
      buildings were gray and beautiful with age, and the streets wound in and
      out among them wonderfully, like a maze.
    </p>
    <p>
      This city lay beside a river or estuary&mdash;though that was something
      that I did not find out until later, as you will see&mdash;and the newer
      part of the town extended mainly on a wide, bare street running along a
      kind of low cliff or embankment, where the basements of the small houses
      on the water-side went down, below the level of the street, to the shore.
      But the older part of the town was closely and intricately built, with
      gabled roofs and heavy carved facades hanging over the narrow stone-paved
      ways, which here and there led out suddenly into open squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in what appeared to be the largest and most important of these
      squares that I was standing, a little before midnight. I had left my wife
      and our little girl in the lodging which we had found, and walked out
      alone to visit the sleeping town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night sky was clear, save for a few filmy clouds, which floated over
      the face of the full moon, obscuring it for an instant, but never
      completely hiding it&mdash;like veils in a shadow dance. The spire of the
      great cathedral was silver filigree on the moonlit side, and on the other
      side, black lace. The square was empty. But on the broad, shallow steps in
      front of the main entrance of the cathedral two heroic figures were
      seated. At first I thought they were statues. Then I perceived they were
      alive, and talking earnestly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were like Greek gods, very strong and beautiful, and naked but for
      some slight drapery that fell snow-white around them. They glistened in
      the moonlight. I could not hear what they were saying; yet I could see
      that they were in a dispute which went to the very roots of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      They resembled each other strangely in form and feature&mdash;like twin
      brothers. But the face of one was noble, lofty, calm, full of a vast
      regret and compassion. The face of the other was proud, resentful, drawn
      with passion. He appeared to be accusing and renouncing his companion,
      breaking away from an ancient friendship in a swift, implacable hatred.
      But the companion seemed to plead with him, and lean toward him, and try
      to draw him closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange fear and sorrow shook my heart. I felt that this mysterious
      contest was something of immense importance; a secret, ominous strife; a
      menace to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the two figures stood up, marvellously alike in strength and beauty,
      yet absolutely different in expression and bearing, the one serene and
      benignant, the other fierce and threatening. The quiet one was still
      pleading, with a hand laid upon the other's shoulder. But he shook it off,
      and thrust his companion away with a proud, impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I heard him speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done with you,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I do not believe in you. I have no more
      need of you. I renounce you. I will live without you. Away forever out of
      my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this a look of ineffable sorrow and pity came upon the great
      companion's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are free,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I have only besought you, never constrained
      you. Since you will have it so, I must leave you, now, to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose into the air, still looking downward with wise eyes full of grief
      and warning, until he vanished in silence beyond the thin clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other did not look up, but lifting his head with a defiant laugh,
      shook his shoulders as if they were free of a burden. He strode swiftly
      around the corner of the cathedral and disappeared among the deep shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of intolerable calamity fell upon me. I said to myself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was Man! And the other was God! And they have parted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the multitude of bells hidden in the lace-work of the high tower
      began to sound. It was not the aerial fluttering music of the carillon
      that I remembered hearing long ago from the belfries of the Low Countries.
      This was a confused and strident ringing, jangled and broken, full of
      sudden tumults and discords, as if the tower were shaken and the bells
      gave out their notes at hazard, in surprise and trepidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stopped as suddenly as it began. The great bell of the hours struck
      twelve. The windows of the cathedral glowed faintly with a light from
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is New Year's Eve,&rdquo; I thought&mdash;although I knew perfectly well
      that the time was late summer. I had seen that though the leaves on the
      trees of the square were no longer fresh, they had not yet fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was certain that I must go into the cathedral. The western entrance was
      shut. I hurried to the south side. The dark, low door of the transept was
      open. I went in. The building was dimly lighted by huge candles which
      flickered and smoked like torches. I noticed that one of them, fastened
      against a pillar, was burning crooked, and the tallow ran down its side in
      thick white tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nave of the church was packed with a vast throng of people, all
      standing, closely crowded together, like the undergrowth in a forest. The
      rood-screen was open, or broken down, I could not tell which. The choir
      was bare, like a clearing in the woods, and filled with blazing light.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the high steps, with his back to the altar, stood Man, his face
      gleaming with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the Lord!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There is none above me! No law, no God! Man is
      power. Man is the highest of all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tremor of wonder and dismay, of excitement and division, shivered
      through the crowd. Some covered their faces. Others stretched out their
      hands. Others shook their fists in the air. A tumult of voices broke from
      the multitude&mdash;voices of exultation, and anger, and horror, and
      strife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The floor of the cathedral was moved and lifted by a mysterious
      ground-swell. The pillars trembled and wavered. The candles flared and
      went out. The crowd, stricken dumb with a panic fear, rushed to the doors,
      burst open the main entrance, and struggling in furious silence poured out
      of the building. I was swept along with them, striving to keep on my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thought possessed me. I must get to my wife and child, save them,
      bring them out of this accursed city.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I hurried across the square I looked up at the cathedral spire. It was
      swaying and rocking in the air like the mast of a ship at sea. The
      lace-work fell from it in blocks of stone. The people rushed screaming
      through the rain of death. Many were struck down, and lay where they fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran as fast as I could. But it was impossible to run far. Every street
      and alley vomited men&mdash;all struggling together, fighting, shouting,
      or shrieking, striking one another down, trampling over the fallen&mdash;a
      hideous melee. There was an incessant rattling noise in the air, and
      heavier peals as of thunder shook the houses. Here a wide rent yawned in a
      wall&mdash;there a roof caved in&mdash;the windows fell into the street in
      showers of broken glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      How I got through this inferno I do not know. Buffeted and blinded,
      stumbling and scrambling to my feet again, turning this way or that way to
      avoid the thickest centres of the strife, oppressed and paralyzed by a
      feeling of impotence that put an iron band around my heart, driven always
      by the intense longing to reach my wife and child, somehow I had a sense
      of struggling on. Then I came into a quieter quarter of the town, and ran
      until I reached the lodging where I had left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were waiting just inside the door, anxious and trembling. But I was
      amazed to find them so little panic-stricken. The little girl had her doll
      in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration with caption: The cathedral spire... was swaying and rocking
      in the air like the mast of a ship at sea.} &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked my wife.
      &ldquo;What must we do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Something frightful has happened here. I can't explain
      now. We must get away at once. Come, quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I took a hand of each and we hastened through the streets, vaguely
      steering away from the centre of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently we came into that wide new street of mean houses, of which I
      have already spoken. There were a few people in it, but they moved heavily
      and feebly, as if some mortal illness lay upon them. Their faces were pale
      and haggard with a helpless anxiety to escape more quickly. The houses
      seemed half deserted. The shades were drawn, the doors closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since it was all so quiet, I thought that we might find some temporary
      shelter there. So I knocked at the door of a house where there was a dim
      light behind the drawn shade in one of the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while the door was opened by a woman who held the end of her shawl
      across her mouth. All that I could see was the black sorrow of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she said slowly; &ldquo;the plague is here. My children are dying of
      it. You must not come in! Go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we hurried on through that plague-smitten street, burdened with a new
      fear. Soon we saw a house on the riverside which looked absolutely empty.
      The shades were up, the windows open, the door stood ajar. I hesitated;
      plucked up courage; resolved that we must get to the waterside in some way
      in order to escape from the net of death which encircled us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let us try to go down through this house. But cover your
      mouths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We groped through the empty passageway, and down the basement-stair. The
      thick cobwebs swept my face. I noted them with joy, for I thought they
      proved that the house had been deserted for some time, and so perhaps it
      might not be infected.
    </p>
    <p>
      We descended into a room which seemed to have been the kitchen. There was
      a stove dimly visible at one side, and an old broken kettle on the floor,
      over which we stumbled. The back door was locked. But it swung outward as
      I broke it open. We stood upon a narrow, dingy beach, where the small
      waves were lapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the &ldquo;little day&rdquo; had begun to whiten the eastern sky; a
      pallid light was diffused; I could see westward down to the main harbor,
      beside the heart of the city. The sails and smoke-stacks of great ships
      were visible, all passing out to sea. I wished that we were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in front of us the water seemed shallower. It was probably only a
      tributary or backwater of the main stream. But it was sprinkled with
      smaller vessels&mdash;sloops, and yawls, and luggers&mdash;all filled with
      people and slowly creeping seaward.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one little boat, quite near to us, which seemed to be waiting
      for some one. There were some people on it, but it was not crowded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this is for us. We must wade out to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I took my wife by the hand, and the child in the other arm, and we went
      into the water. Soon it came up to our knees, to our waists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; shouted the old man at the tiller. &ldquo;No time to spare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a minute more,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;only one minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That minute seemed like a year. The sail of the boat was shaking in the
      wind. When it filled she must move away. We waded on, and at last I
      grasped the gunwale of the boat. I lifted the child in and helped my wife
      to climb over the side. They clung to me. The little vessel began to move
      gently away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get in,&rdquo; cried the old man sharply; &ldquo;get in quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I felt that I could not, I dared not. I let go of the boat. I cried
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; and turned to wade ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was compelled to go back to the doomed city. I must know what would come
      of the parting of Man from God!
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide was running out more swiftly. The water swirled around my knees.
      I awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the dream remained with me, just as I have told it to you.

    <h2>
      ANTWERP ROAD
    </h2>
    <h3>
      {OCTOBER, 1914}
    </h3>
    <p>
      Along the straight, glistening road, through a dim arcade of drooping
      trees, a tunnel of faded green and gold, dripping with the misty rain of a
      late October afternoon, a human tide was flowing, not swiftly, but slowly,
      with the patient, pathetic slowness of weary feet, and numb brains, and
      heavy hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet they were in haste, all of these old men and women, fathers and
      mothers, and little children; they were flying as fast as they could;
      either away from something that they feared, or toward something that they
      desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the strange thing&mdash;the tide on the road flowed in two
      directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some fled away from ruined homes to escape the perils of war. Some fled
      back to ruined homes to escape the desolation of exile. But all were
      fugitives, anxious to be gone, striving along the road one way or the
      other, and making no more speed than a creeping snail's pace of
      unutterable fatigue. I saw many separate things in the tide, and
      remembered them without noting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy straining to push a wheelbarrow with his pale mother in it, and his
      two little sisters trudging at his side. A peasant with his two girls
      driving their lean, dejected cows back to some unknown pasture. A bony
      horse tugging at a wagon heaped high with bedding and household gear, on
      top of which sat the wrinkled grandmother with the tiniest baby in her
      arms, while the rest of the family stumbled alongside&mdash;and the cat
      was curled up on the softest coverlet in the wagon. Two panting dogs, with
      red tongues hanging out, and splayed feet clawing the road, tugging a
      heavy-laden cart while the master pushed behind and the woman pulled in
      the shafts. Strange, antique vehicles crammed with passengers. Couples and
      groups and sometimes larger companies of foot-travellers. Now and then a
      solitary man or woman, old and shabby, bundle on back, eyes on the road,
      plodding through the mud and the mist, under the high archway of yellowing
      leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: All were fugitives, anxious to be gone, ... and making no
      more speed than a creeping snail's pace of unutterable fatigue.}
    </p>
    <p>
      All these distinct pictures I saw, yet it was all one vision&mdash;a
      vision of humanity with its dumb companions in flight&mdash;infinitely
      slow, painful, pitiful flight!
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw no tears, I heard no cries of complaint. But beneath the numb and
      patient haste on all those dazed faces I saw a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;What have we done? Why has this thing come upon us and our children?&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere I heard a trumpet blown. The brazen spikes on the helmets of a
      little troop of German soldiers flashed for an instant, far down the
      sloppy road. Through the humid dusk came the dull, distant booming of the
      unseen guns of conquest in Flanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the only answer.
    </p>

    <h2>
      A CITY OF REFUGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the dark autumn of 1914 the City sprang up almost in a night, as if by
      enchantment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was white magic that called it into being&mdash;the deep, quiet, strong
      impulse of compassion and protection that moved the motherly heart of
      Holland when she saw the hundreds of thousands of Belgian fugitives
      pouring out of their bleeding, ravaged land, and running, stumbling,
      creeping on hands and knees, blindly, instinctively turning to her for
      safety and help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me,&rdquo; she said, like a good woman who holds out her arms and
      spreads her knees to make a lap for tired and frightened children, &ldquo;come
      to me. I will take care of you. You shall be safe with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All doors were open. The little brick farmhouses and cottages with their
      gayly painted window-shutters; the long rows of city houses with their
      steep gables; the prim and placid country mansions set among their high
      trees and formal flower-gardens&mdash;all kinds of dwellings, from the
      poorest to the richest, welcomed these guests of sorrow and distress. Many
      a humble family drained its savings-bank reservoir to keep the stream of
      its hospitality flowing. Unused factories were turned into barracks.
      Deserted summer hotels were filled up. Even empty greenhouses were adapted
      to the need of human horticulture. All Holland was enrolled, formally or
      informally, in a big <i>Comite voor Belgische Slachtoffers.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon it was evident that the impromptu methods of generosity could not
      meet the demands of the case. Private resources were exhausted. Poor
      people could no longer feed and clothe their poorer guests. Families were
      unhappily divided. In the huge flock of exiles driven out by the cruel
      German Terror there were goats as well as sheep, and some of them
      bewildered and shocked the orderly Dutch homes where they were sheltered,
      by their nocturnal habits and negligible morals. Something had to be done
      to bring order and system into the chaos of brotherly love. Otherwise the
      neat Dutch mind which is so close to the Dutch heart could not rest in its
      bed. This vast trouble which the evil of German militarism had thrust upon
      a helpless folk must be helped out by a wise touch of military
      organization, which is a good thing even for the most peaceful people.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that the City of Refuge (and others like it) grew up swiftly in
      the wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stands in the heathland that slopes and rolls from the wooded hills of
      Gelderland to the southern shore of the Zuider Zee&mdash;a sandy country
      overgrown with scrub-oaks and pines and heather&mdash;yet very healthy and
      well drained, and not unfertile under cultivation. You may see that in the
      little neighbor-village, where the trees arch over the streets, and the
      kitchen-gardens prosper, and the shrubs and flowers bloom abundantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small houses and hotels of this tiny summer resort are of brick. It
      has an old, well-established look; a place of relaxation with restraint,
      not of ungirdled frivolity. The plain Dutch people love their holidays,
      but they take them serenely and by rule: long walks and bicycle-rides,
      placid and nourishing picnics in the woods or by the sea, afternoon
      tea-parties in sheltered arbors. One of their favorite names for a
      country-place is <i>Wel Teweden,</i> &ldquo;perfectly contented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commandant of the City of Refuge lives in one of the little brick
      houses of the village. He is a portly, rosy old bachelor, with a curly
      brown beard and a military bearing; a man of fine education and wide
      experience, seasoned in colonial diplomacy. The ruling idea in his mind is
      discipline, authority. His official speech is abrupt and final, the manner
      of a martinet covering a heart full of kindness and generous impulses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he says, after a good breakfast, &ldquo;I want you to see my camp. It is
      not as fine and fancy as the later ones. But we built it in a hurry and we
      had it ready on time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A short ride over a sandy road brings you to the city gate&mdash;an
      opening in the wire enclosure of perhaps two or three square miles among
      the dwarf pines and oaks. The guard-house is kept by a squad of Dutch
      soldiers. But it is in no sense a prison-camp, for people are coming and
      going freely all the time, and the only rules within are those of decency
      and good order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capacity, ten thousand,&rdquo; says the commandant, sweeping his hand around
      the open circle, &ldquo;quite a city, <i>niet waar?</i> I will show you the
      various arrangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the buildings are of wood, a mushroom city, but constructed with
      intelligence to meet the needs of the sudden, helpless population. You
      visit the big kitchen with its ever-simmering kettles; the dining-halls
      with their long tables and benches; the schoolhouses full of lively,
      irrepressible children; the wash-house where always talkative and jocose
      laundresses are scrubbing and wringing the clothes; the sewing-rooms where
      hundreds of women and girls are busy with garments and gossip; the chapel
      where religious services are held by the devoted pastors; the
      recreation-room which is the social centre of the city; the clothing
      storerooms where you find several American girls working for love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then you go through the long family barracks where each family has a
      separate cubicle, more or less neat and comfortable, sometimes prettily
      decorated, according to the family taste and habit; the barracks for the
      single men; the barracks for the single women; the two hospitals, one
      general, the other for infectious diseases; and last of all, the house
      where the half-dozen disorderly women are confined, surrounded by a double
      fence of barbed wire and guarded by a sentry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor, wretched creatures! You are sorry for them. Why not put the
      disorderly men into a house of confinement, too?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says the commandant bluntly, &ldquo;we find it easier and better to send
      the disorderly men to jail or hospital in some near town. We are easier
      with the women. I pity them. But they are full of poison. We can't let
      them go loose in the camp for fear of infection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How many of the roots of human nature are uncovered in a place like this!
      The branches and the foliage and the blossoms, too, are seen more clearly
      in this air where all things are necessarily open and in common.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men are generally less industrious than the women. But they work
      willingly at the grading of roads and paths, the laying out and planting
      of flower-beds, the construction of ornamental designs, of doubtful taste
      but unquestionable sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You read the names which they have given to the different streets and
      barracks, and the passageways between the cubicles, and you understand the
      strong, instinctive love which binds them to their native Belgium.
      &ldquo;Antwerp Avenue,&rdquo; &ldquo;Louvain Avenue,&rdquo; &ldquo;Malines Street,&rdquo; &ldquo;Liege Street,&rdquo; and
      streets bearing the names of many ruined towns and villages of which you
      have never heard, but which are forever dear to the hearts of these
      exiles. The names of the hero-king, Albert, and of his brave consort,
      Queen Elizabeth, are honored by inscriptions, and their pictures, cut
      from, newspapers, decorate the schoolrooms and the little family cubicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brutal power which reigns at Berlin may drive the Belgians out of
      Belgium by terror and oppression. But it cannot drive Belgium out of the
      hearts of the Belgians. While they live their country lives, and Albert is
      still their King.
    </p>
    <p>
      But think of the unnatural conditions into which these thousands of human
      beings&mdash;yes, and hundreds of thousands like them, torn from their
      homes, uprooted, dispersed, impoverished&mdash;are forced by this bitter,
      cruel war. Think of the cold and ruined hearthstones, the scattered
      families, the shelterless children, the desolate and broken hearts. This
      is what Germany has inflicted upon mankind in order to realize her
      robber-dream!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the City of Refuge, being human, has its bright spots and its bits of
      compensation. Here is one, out of many.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief nurse, a young Dutch lady of charming face and manners, serving
      as a volunteer under the sacred sign of the Red Cross, comes in, one
      morning, to make her report to the commandant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, disguising in his big voice of command the warm
      admiration which he feels for the lady, &ldquo;what is the trouble to-day? Speak
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; she answers calmly. &ldquo;Everything is going on pretty well.
      No new cases of measles&mdash;those in hospital improving. The only thing
      that bothers me is the continual complaint about that Mrs. Van Orley&mdash;you
      remember her, a thin, dark little person. She is melancholy and morose,
      quarrels all the time, says some one has stolen her children. The people
      near her in the barracks complain that she disturbs them at night, moans
      and talks aloud in her sleep, jumps up and runs down the corridor laughing
      or crying: 'Here they are!' They don't believe she ever had any children.
      They think she is crazy and want her put out. But I don't agree with that.
      I think she has had children, and now she has dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send her away,&rdquo; growls the commandant; &ldquo;send her to a sanatorium! This
      camp is not a lunatic asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; interposes the nurse in her most discreet voice, &ldquo;she is really a
      very nice woman. If you would allow me to take her on as a housemaid in
      the general hospital, I think I could make something out of her; at least
      I should like to try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have your own way,&rdquo; says the commandant, relenting; &ldquo;you always do. Now
      tell me the next trouble. You have something more up your sleeve, I'm
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babies,&rdquo; she replies demurely; &ldquo;two babies from Amsterdam. Lost, somehow
      or other, in the flight. No trace of their people. A family in Zaandam has
      been taking care of them, but can't afford it any longer. So the Amsterdam
      committee has sent them here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commandant has listened, his cheeks growing redder and redder, his
      eyes rounder and more prominent. He springs up and paces the floor in
      wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babies!&rdquo; he cries stormily. &ldquo;By all the gods, da&mdash;those
      Amsterdammers! Excuse me, but this is too much. Do they think this is a
      foundling asylum? or a nursing home? Babies! What in Heaven's name am I to
      do with them? Babies! Where are those babies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just outside, and very nice babies indeed,&rdquo; says the nurse, opening the
      hall door and giving a soft call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter a slim black-haired boy of about three and a half years and a plump
      golden-haired girl about a year younger. They toddle to the nurse and
      snuggle against her blue dress and white apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling she guides them toward the commandant and says: &ldquo;Here they are,
      sir. How do you like them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That terrific personage has been suddenly transformed from haircloth into
      silk. He beams, and pulling out his fat gold watch, coos like a hoarse
      dove: &ldquo;Look here, <i>kinderen</i>, come and hear the bells in my
      tick-tock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently he has one of them leaning against the inside of each knee,
      listening ardently to the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;What is your name, youngster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hendrik,&rdquo; answers the boy, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hendrik <i>what?</i> You have another name, haven't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy shakes his head and looks puzzled, as if the thought of two names
      were too much for him. <i>&ldquo;Hendrik,&rdquo;</i> he repeats more clearly and
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is her name?&rdquo; asks the commandant, patting the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Sooss,&rdquo;</i> answers the boy. &ldquo;Mama say <i>'ickle angel.'</i> Hendrik
      say <i>Sooss.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      All effort to get any more information from the children was fruitless.
      They were too small to remember much, and what they did remember was of
      their own size&mdash;only very little things, of no importance except to
      themselves. The commandant looks at the nurse quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, miss, you have unloaded these vague babies on me. What do you
      propose that I should do with them? Adopt them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, anyhow,&rdquo; she answers, smiling broadly. &ldquo;Let us take them up to
      the camp. I'll bet we can find some one there to look after them. What do
      you say, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he sighs, &ldquo;have your own way as usual! Just ring that bell
      for the automobile, <i>als't-Ublieft.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the busy sewing-room the two children are standing up on one of the
      tables. The commandant has an arm around each of them, for they are a
      little frightened by so much noise and so many eyes looking at them. The
      chatter dies down, as he speaks in his gruff authoritative voice, but with
      a twinkle in his eyes, rather like a middle-aged Santa Claus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here! I've got two fine babies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A titter runs through the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Ja, Men'eer,&rdquo;</i> says one of the women, &ldquo;congratulations! They are <i>lievelingen</i>&mdash;darlings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; growls the commandant amiably. &ldquo;None of your impudence, you
      women. Look here! These two children&mdash;I want somebody to adopt them,
      or at least to take care of them. I will pay for them. Their names are
      Hendrik and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A commotion at the lower end of the room. A thin, dark little woman is
      standing up, waving her piece of sewing like a flag, her big eyes flaming
      with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she cries, hurrying and stumbling forward through the crowd of
      women and girls. &ldquo;Oh, stop a minute! They are mine&mdash;I lost them&mdash;mine,
      I tell you&mdash;lost&mdash;mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reaches the head of the table and flings her arms around the boy,
      crying: &ldquo;My Hendrik!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy hesitates a second, startled by the sudden wildness of her caress.
      Then he presses his hot little face in her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Lieve moeder!&rdquo;</i> he murmurs. &ldquo;Where was you? I looked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the thin, dark little woman has fainted dead away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest we will leave, as the wise commandant does, to the chief nurse.

    <h2>
      A SANCTUARY OF TREES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Baron d'Azan was old&mdash;older even than his seventy years. His age
      showed by contrast as he walked among his trees. They were fresh and
      flourishing, full of sap and vigor, though many of them had been born long
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tracts of forest which still belonged to his diminished estate were
      crowded with the growths native to the foot-hills of the Ardennes. In the
      park around the small chateau, built in a Belgian version of the First
      Empire style, trees from many lands had been assembled by his father and
      grandfather: drooping spruces from Norway, dark-pillared cypresses from
      Italy, spreading cedars from Lebanon, trees of heaven from China,
      fern-leaved gingkos from Japan, lofty tulip-trees and liquidambars from
      America, and fantastic sylvan forms from islands of the Southern Ocean.
      But the royal avenue of beeches! Well, I must tell you more about that,
      else you can never feel the meaning of this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The love of trees was hereditary in the family and antedated their other
      nobility. The founder of the house had begun life as the son of a forester
      in Luxemburg. His name was Pol Staar. His fortune and title were the fruit
      of contracts for horses and provisions which he made with the commissariat
      of Napoleon I. in the days when the Netherlands were a French province.
      But though Pol Staar's hands were callous and his manners plain, his
      tastes were aristocratic. They had been formed young in the company of
      great trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore when he bought his estate of Azan (and took his title from it)
      he built his chateau in a style which he considered complimentary to his
      imperial patron, but he was careful also to include within his domain
      large woodlands in which he could renew the allegiance of his youth. These
      woodlands he cherished and improved, cutting with discretion, planting
      with liberality, and rejoicing in the thought that trees like those which
      had befriended his boyhood would give their friendly protection to his
      heirs. These are traits of an aristocrat&mdash;attachment to the past, and
      careful provision for posterity. It was in this spirit that Pol Staar,
      first Baron d'Azan, planted in 1809 the broad avenue of beeches, leading
      from the chateau straight across the park to the highroad. But he never
      saw their glory, for he died when they were only twenty years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son and successor was of a different timber and grain; less
      aristocratic, more bourgeois&mdash;a rover, a gambler, a man of fashion.
      He migrated from the gaming-tables at Spa to the Bourse at Paris, perching
      at many clubs between and beyond, and making seasonal nests in several
      places. This left him little time for the Chdteau d'Azan. But he came
      there every spring and autumn, and showed the family fondness for trees in
      his own fashion. He loved the forests so much that he ate them. He cut
      with liberality and planted without discretion. But for the great avenue
      of beeches he had a saving admiration. Not even to support the
      gaming-table would he have allowed them to be felled.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he turned the corner of his thirty-first year he had a sharp illness,
      a temporary reformation, and brought home as his wife a very young lovely
      actress from the ducal theatre at Saxe-Meiningen. She was a good girl,
      deeply in love with her handsome husband, to whom she bore a son and heir
      in the first year of their marriage. Not many moons thereafter the pleased
      but restless father slid back into his old rounds again. The forest waned
      and the debts waxed. Rumors of wild doings came from Spa and Aix, from
      Homburg and Baden, from Trouville and Ostend. After four years of this the
      young mother died, of no namable disease, unless you call it
      heart-failure, and the boy was left to his grandmother's care and company
      among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day when it was fair the old lady and the little lad took their
      afternoon walk together in the beech-tree avenue, where the tips of the
      branches now reached the road. At other times he roamed the outlying woods
      and learned to know the birds and the little wild animals. When he was
      twelve his grandmother died. After that he was left mainly to the
      housekeeper, his tutors, and the few friends he could make among the
      children of the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished his third year at the University of Louvain and
      attained his majority, his father returned express-haste from somewhere in
      Bohemia, to attend the coronation of Leopold II, that remarkable King of
      Belgium and the Bourse. But by this time the gay Baron d'Azan had become
      stout, the pillar of his neck seemed shorter because it was thicker, and
      the rose in his bold cheek had the purplish tint of a crimson rambler. So
      he died of an apoplexy during the festivities, and his son brought him
      back to the Chateau d'Azan, and buried him there with due honor, and
      mourned for him as was fitting. Thus Albert, third Baron d'Azan, entered
      upon his inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, at first, to consist mainly of debts. These were paid by the
      sale of the deforested lands and of certain detached woodlands. By the
      same method, much as he disliked it, he made a modest provision of money
      for continuing his education and beginning his travels. He knew that he
      had much to learn of the world, and he was especially desirous of pursuing
      his favorite study of botany, which a wise old priest at Louvain had
      taught him to love. So he engaged an intelligent and faithful forester to
      care for the trees and the estate, closed the house, and set forth on his
      journeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      They led him far and wide. In the course of them no doubt he studied other
      things than botany. It may be that he sowed some of the wild oats with
      which youth is endowed; but not in the gardens of others; nor with that
      cold self-indulgence which transforms passionate impulse into sensual
      habit. He had a permanent and regulative devotion to botanical research;
      and that is a study which seems to promote modesty, tranquillity, and
      steadiness of mind in its devotees, of whom the great Linnaeus is the
      shining exemplar. Young Albert d'Azan sat at the feet of the best masters
      in Europe and America. He crossed the western continent to observe the
      oldest of living things, the giant Sequoias of California. He went to
      Australasia and the Dutch East Indies and South America in search of new
      ferns and orchids. He investigated the effect of ocean currents and of
      tribal migrations in the distribution of trees. His botanical monographs
      brought him renown among those who know, and he was elected a
      corresponding member of many scientific societies. After twenty years of
      voyaging he returned to port at Azan, richly laden with observation and
      learning, and settled down among his trees to pursue his studies and write
      his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      The estate, under the forester's care, had improved a little and promised
      a modest income. The house, though somewhat dilapidated, was easily made
      livable. But the one thing that was full of glory and splendor,
      triumphantly prosperous, was the great avenue of beeches. Their long, low
      aisle of broad arches was complete. They shimmered with a pearly mist of
      buds in early spring and later with luminous green of tender leafage. In
      mid-summer they formed a wide, still stream of dark, unruffled verdure; in
      autumn they were transmuted through glowing yellow into russet gold; in
      winter their massy trunks were pillars of gray marble and the fan-tracery
      of their rounded branches was delicately etched against the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at them,&rdquo; the baron would say to the guests whom the fame of his
      learning and the charm of his wide-ranging conversation often brought to
      his house. &ldquo;Those beeches were planted by my grandfather after the battle
      of Wagram, when Napoleon whipped the Austrians. After that came the
      Beresina and Leipsic and Waterloo and how many battles and wars of
      furious, perishable men. Yet the trees live on peaceably, they unfold
      their strength in beauty, they have not yet reached the summit of their grandeur.
      We are all <i>parvenus</i> beside them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had to choose,&rdquo; asked the great sculptor Constantin Meunier one
      day, &ldquo;would you have your house or one of these trees struck by
      lightning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house,&rdquo; answered the botanist promptly, &ldquo;for I could rebuild it in a
      year; but to restore the tree would take three-quarters of a century.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also,&rdquo; said the sculptor, with a smile, &ldquo;you might change the style of
      your house with advantage, but the style of these trees you could never
      improve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is it true, as they say, that lightning
      never strikes a beech?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not entirely true,&rdquo; replied the botanist, smiling in his turn,
      &ldquo;yet, like many ancient beliefs, it has some truth in it. There is
      something in the texture of the beech that seems to resist electricity
      better than other trees. It may be the fatness of the wood. Whatever it
      is, I am glad of it, for it gives my trees a better chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be too secure,&rdquo; said the sculptor, shaking his head. &ldquo;There are
      other tempests besides those in the clouds. When the next war comes in
      western Europe Belgium will be the battle-field. Beech-wood is very good
      to burn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; said the baron devoutly. &ldquo;We have had peace for a quarter of
      a century. Why should it not last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask the wise men of the East,&rdquo; replied the sculptor grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was a little past fifty the baron married, with steadfast choice
      and deep affection, the orphan daughter of a noble family of Hainault. She
      was about half his age; of a tranquil, cheerful temper and a charm that
      depended less on feature than on expression; a lover of music, books, and
      a quiet life. She brought him a small dowry by which the chateau was
      restored to comfort, and bore him two children, a boy and a girl, by whom
      it was enlivened with natural gayety. The next twenty years were the
      happiest that Albert d'Azan and his wife ever saw. The grand avenue of
      beeches became to them the unconscious symbol of something settled and
      serene, august, protective, sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a brilliant morning of early April, 1914, they had stepped out together
      to drink the air. The beeches were in misty, silver bloom above them. All
      around was peace and gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to tell you a dream I had last night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a strange dream
      about our beeches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was sad,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;do not let the shadow of it fall on the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was not sad. It seemed rather to bring light and comfort. I
      dreamed that I was dead and you had buried me at the foot of the largest
      of the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call that not sad?&rdquo; she interrupted reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did not seem so. Wait a moment and you shall hear the way of it. At
      first I felt only a deep quietness and repose, like one who has been in
      pain and is very tired and lies down in the shade to sleep. Then I was
      waking again and something was drawing me gently upward. I cannot exactly
      explain it, but it was as if I were passing through the roots and the
      trunk and the boughs of the beech-tree toward the upper air. There I saw
      the light again and heard the birds singing and the wind rustling among
      the leaves. How I saw and heard I cannot tell you, for there was no
      remembrance of a body in my dream. Then suddenly my soul&mdash;I suppose
      it was that&mdash;stood before God and He was asking me: 'How did you come
      hither?' I answered, 'By Christ's way, by the way of a tree.' And He said
      it was well, and that my work in heaven should be the care of the trees
      growing by the river of life, and that sometimes I could go back to visit
      my trees on earth, if I wished. That made me very glad, for I knew that so
      I should see you and our children under the beeches. And while I was
      wondering whether you would ever know that I was there, the dream
      dissolved, and I saw the morning light on the tree-tops. What do you think
      of my dream? Childish, wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought a little before she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was natural enough, though vague. Of course we could not be buried at
      the foot of the beech-tree unless Cardinal Mercier would permit a plot of
      ground to be consecrated there. But come, it is time to go in to
      breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to dismiss the matter from her mind. Yet, as women so often do,
      she kept all these sayings and pondered them in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promise of spring passed into the sultry heat of summer. The
      storm-cloud of the twentieth century blackened over Europe. The wise men
      of Berlin made mad by pride, devoted the world not to the Prince of Peace
      but to the lords of war. In the first week of August the fury of the
      German invasion broke on Belgium. No one had dared to dream the terrors of
      that tempest. It was like a return of the Dark Ages. Every home trembled.
      The pillars of the tranquil house of Azan were shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter was away at school in England, and that was an unmixed
      blessing. The son was a lieutenant in the Belgian army; and that was right
      and glorious, but it was also a dreadful anxiety. The father and mother
      were divided in mind, Whether to stay or take flight with their friends.
      At last the father decided the hard question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our duty to stay. We cannot fight for our country, but we can
      suffer with her. Our daughter is in safety; our son's danger we cannot and
      would not prevent. How could we really live away from here, our home, our
      trees? I went to consult the cardinal. He stays, and he advises us to do
      so. He says that will be the best way to show our devotion. As Christians
      we must endure the evil that we cannot prevent; but as Belgians our hearts
      will never consent to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was their attitude as the tide of blood and tears drew nearer to
      them, surrounded them, swept beyond them, engulfed the whole land. The
      brutal massacres at Andenne and Dinant were so near that the news arrived
      before the spilt blood was dry. The exceeding great and bitter cry of
      anguish came to them from a score of neighboring villages, from a hundred
      lonely farmhouses. The old botanist withered and faded daily; his wife
      grew pale and gray. Yet they walked their <i>via crucis</i> together, and
      kept their chosen course.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fed the hungry and clothed the naked, helped the fugitives and
      consoled the broken-hearted. They counselled their poor neighbors to good
      order, and dissuaded the ignorant from the folly and peril of violence.
      Toward the invading soldiery their conduct was beyond reproach. With no
      false professions of friendship, they fulfilled the hard services which
      were required of them. Their servants had been helped away at the
      beginning of the trouble&mdash;all except the old forester and his wife,
      who refused to leave. With their aid the house was kept open and many of
      the conquerors lodged there and in the outbuildings. So good were the
      quarters that a departing Saxon chalked on the gate-post the dubious
      inscription: <i>&ldquo;Gute Leute-nicht auspliin-dern.&rdquo;</i> Thus the captives at
      the Chateau d'Azan had a good name even among their enemies. The baron
      received a military pass which enabled him to move quite freely about the
      district on his errands of necessity and mercy, and the chateau became a
      favorite billet for high-born officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second year of the war an evil chance brought two uninvited guests
      of very high standing indeed&mdash;that is to say in the social ring of
      Potsdam. Their names are well known. Let us call them Prince Barenberg and
      Count Ludra. The first was a major, the second a captain. Their value as
      warriors in the field had not proved equal to their prominence as
      noblemen, so they were given duty in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were vicious coxcombs of the first order. Their uniforms incased them
      tightly. Like wasps they bent only at the waist. Their flat-topped caps
      were worn with an aggressive slant, their swords jingled menacingly, their
      hay-colored mustaches spoke arrogance in every upturned hair. When they
      bowed it was a mockery; when they smiled it was a sneer. For the
      comfortable quarters of the Chateau d'Azan they had a gross appreciation,
      for the enforced hospitality of its owners an insolent condescension. They
      took it as their due, and resented the silent protest underneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent wine, Herr Baron,&rdquo; said the prince, who, like his comrade,
      drank profusely of the best in the cellar. &ldquo;Your Rudesheimer Berg '94 is
      <i>kolossal.</i> Very friendly of you to save it for us. We Germans know
      good wine. What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have that reputation,&rdquo; answered the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And say,&rdquo; added the count, &ldquo;let us have a couple of bottles more, dear
      landlord. You can put it in the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do so,&rdquo; said the baron gravely. &ldquo;It shall be put in the bill with
      other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; drawled the prince, &ldquo;does <i>la Baronne</i> never favor us with
      her company? Still very attractive&mdash;musical probably&mdash;here is a
      piano&mdash;want good German music&mdash;console homesickness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame is indisposed,&rdquo; answered the baron quietly, &ldquo;but you may be sure
      she regrets your absence from home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officers looked at each other with half-tipsy, half-angry eyes. They
      suspected a jest at their expense, but could not quite catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impudence,&rdquo; muttered the count, who was the sharper of the two when
      sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;it is only stupidity. These Walloons have no wit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he added, turning to the baron, &ldquo;we sing you a good song of
      fatherland&mdash;show how <i>gemuthlich</i> we Germans are. You Belgians
      have no word for that. What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down to the piano and pounded out <i>&ldquo;Deutschland ueber Alles,&rdquo;</i>
      singing the air in a raucous voice, while Ludra added a rumbling bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that? All Germans can sing. <i>Gemuthlich.</i>
      What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the baron, with downcast eyes. &ldquo;We Belgians have no
      word for that. It is inexpressible&mdash;except in German. I bid you good
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For nearly a fortnight this condition of affairs continued. The baron
      endured it as best he could, obeying scrupulously the military regulations
      which necessity laid upon him, and taking his revenge only in long
      thoughts and words of polite sarcasm which he knew would not be
      understood. The baroness worked hard at the housekeeping, often cooking
      and cleaning with her own hands, and rejoicing secretly with her husband
      over the rare news that came from their daughter in England, from their
      boy at the front in West Flanders. Sometimes, when the coast was clear,
      husband and wife walked together under the beech-trees and talked in low
      tones of the time when the ravenous beast should no more go up on the
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two noble officers performed their routine duties, found such
      amusement as they could in neighboring villages and towns, drank deep at
      night, and taxed their ingenuity to invent small ways of annoying their
      hosts, for whom they felt the contemptuous dislike of the injurer for the
      injured. They were careful, however, to keep their malice within certain
      bounds, for they knew that the baron was in favor with the commandant of
      the district.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning the baron and his wife, looking from their window in a wing of
      the house, saw with surprise and horror a score or more of German soldiers
      assembled beside the beech-avenue, with axes and saws, preparing to begin
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they going to do there?&rdquo; cried he in dismay, and hurried down to
      the dining-room, where the officers sat at breakfast, giving orders to an
      attentive corporal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons, Highness,&rdquo; interrupted the baron; &ldquo;forgive my haste.
      But surely you are not going to cut down my avenue of beeches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the prince, swinging around in his chair. &ldquo;They are good
      wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; stammered the baron, trembling with excitement, &ldquo;those trees&mdash;they
      are an ancient heritage of the house&mdash;planted by my grandfather a
      century ago&mdash;an old possession&mdash;spare them for their age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You exaggerate,&rdquo; sneered the prince. &ldquo;They are not old. I have on my
      hunting estate in Thuringia oaks five hundred years old. These trees of
      yours are mere upstarts. Why shouldn't they be cut? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are very dear to us,&rdquo; pleaded the baron earnestly. &ldquo;We all love
      them, my wife and children and I. To us they are sacred. It would be harsh
      to take them from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baron,&rdquo; said the prince, with suave malice, &ldquo;you miss the point. We
      Germans are never harsh. But we are practical. My soldiers need exercise.
      The camps need wood. Do you see? What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered the poor baron, humbling himself in his devotion to
      his trees. &ldquo;Your Highness makes the point perfectly clear&mdash;the need
      of exercise and wood. But there is plenty of good timber in the forest and
      the park&mdash;much easier to cut. Cannot your men get their wood and
      their exercise there, and spare my dearest trees?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ludra laughed unpleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not yet understand us, dear landlord. We Germans are a
      hard-working people, not like the lazy Belgians. The harder the work the
      better we like it. The soldiers will have a fine time chopping down your
      tough beeches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slender old man drew himself up, his eyes flashed, he was driven to
      bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not do this,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It is an outrage, a sacrilege. I shall
      appeal to the commandant. He will protect my rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officers looked at each other. Deaf to pity, they had keen ears for
      danger. A reproof, perhaps a punishment from their superior would be most
      unpleasant. They hesitated to face it. But they were too obstinate to give
      up their malicious design altogether with a good grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Military necessity,&rdquo; growled the prince, &ldquo;knows no private rights. I
      advise you, baron, not to appeal to the commandant. It will be useless,
      perhaps harmful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, you,&rdquo; he said gruffly, turning to the corporal, &ldquo;carry out my
      orders. Cut the two marked beeches by the gate. Then take your men into
      the park and cut the biggest trees there. Report for further orders
      to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wooden-faced giant saluted, swung on his heels, and marched stiffly
      out. The baron followed him quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that entreaties would be wasted on the corporal. How to get to the
      commandant, that was the question? He would not be allowed to use the
      telephone which was in the dining-room, nor the automobile which belonged
      to the officers; nor one of their horses which were in his stable. The
      only other beast left there was a small and very antique donkey which the
      children used to drive. In a dilapidated go-cart, drawn by this pattering
      nag, the baron made such haste as he could along twelve miles of stony
      road to the district headquarters. There he told his story simply to the
      commandant and begged protection for his beloved trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old general was of a different type from the fire-eating dandies who
      played the master at Azan. He listened courteously and gravely. There was
      a picture in his mind of the old timbered house in the Hohe Venn, where he
      had spent four years in retirement before the war called him back to the
      colors. He thought of the tall lindens and the spreading chestnuts around
      it and imagined how he should feel if he saw them falling under the axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said to his petitioner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have acted quite correctly, <i>Monsieur le Baron,</i> in bringing
      this matter quietly to my attention. There is no military necessity for
      the destruction of your fine trees. I shall put a stop to it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called his aide-de-camp and gave some instructions in a low tone of
      voice. When the aide came back from the telephone and reported, the
      general frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unheard of,&rdquo; he muttered, half to himself, &ldquo;the way those titled
      young fools go beyond their orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, <i>Monsieur le Baron,</i> but two of your beeches have
      already fallen. It cannot be helped now. But there shall be no more of it,
      I promise you. Those young officers are&mdash;they are&mdash;let us call
      them overzealous. I will transfer them to another post to-morrow. The
      German command appreciates the correct conduct of you and <i>Madame la
      Baronne.</i> Is there anything more that I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank your Excellency sincerely,&rdquo; replied the baron. Then he hesitated
      a moment, as if to weigh his words. &ldquo;No, <i>Herr General,</i> I believe
      there is nothing more&mdash;in which you can help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old soldier's eyelids flickered for an instant. &ldquo;Then I bid you a very
      good day,&rdquo; he said, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron hurried home, to share the big good news with his wife. The
      little bad news she knew already. Together they grieved over the two
      fallen trees and rejoiced under the golden shadow of their untouched
      companions. The officers had called for wine, and more wine, and yet more
      wine, and were drinking deep and singing loud in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning came an orderly with a despatch from headquarters, ordering
      the prince and the count to duty in a dirty village of the coal region.
      Their baggage was packed into the automobile, and they mounted their
      horses and went away in a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be sorry for this, dumbhead,&rdquo; growled the prince, scowling
      fiercely. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Ludra, with a hateful grin, &ldquo;we shall meet again,
      dear landlord, and you will be sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their host bowed and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some weeks later the princely automobile came to the door of the chateau.
      The forester brought up word that the Prince Barenberg and the Count Ludra
      were below with a message from headquarters; the commandant wished the
      baron to come there immediately; the automobile was sent to bring him. He
      made ready to go. His wife and his servant tried hard to dissuade him: it
      was late, almost dark, and very cold&mdash;not likely the commandant had
      sent for him&mdash;it might be all a trick of those officers&mdash;they
      were hateful men&mdash;they would play some cruel prank for revenge. But
      the old man was obstinate in his resolve; he must do what was required of
      him, he must not even run the risk of slighting the commandant's wishes;
      after all, no great harm could come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the steps he saw the count in the front seat, beside the
      chauffeur, grinning; and the prince's harsh voice, made soft as possible,
      called from the shadowy interior of the car:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, baron. The general has sent for you in a hurry. We will take you
      like lightning. How fine your beeches look against the sky. What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man stepped into the dusky car. It rolled down the long aisle,
      between the smooth gray columns, beneath the fan-tracery of the low
      arches, out on to the stony highway. Thus the tree-lover was taken from
      his sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not return the next day, nor the day after. His wife, tortured by
      anxiety, went to the district headquarters. The commandant was away. The
      aide could not enlighten her. There had been no message sent to the baron&mdash;that
      was certain. Major Barenberg and Captain Ludra had been transferred to
      another command. Unfortunately, nothing could be done except to report the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brave woman was not broken by her anguish, but raised to the height of
      heroic devotion. She dedicated herself to the search for her husband. The
      faithful forester, convinced that his master had been killed, was like a
      slow, sure bloodhound on the track of the murderers. He got a trace of
      them in a neighboring village, where their car had been seen to pass at
      dusk on the fatal day. The officers were in it, but not the baron. The
      forester got a stronger scent of them in a wine-house, where their
      chauffeur had babbled mysteriously on the following day. The old woodsman
      followed the trail with inexhaustible patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall bring the master's body home,&rdquo; he said to his mistress, &ldquo;and God
      will use me to avenge his murder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks later he found his master's corpse hidden in a hollow on the
      edge of the forest, half-covered with broken branches, rotting leaves, and
      melting snow. There were three bullets in the body. They had been fired at
      close range.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow's heart, passing from the torture of uncertainty to the calm of
      settled grief, had still a sacred duty to live for. She had not forgotten
      her husband's dream. She went to the cardinal-archbishop to beg the
      consecration of a little burial-plot at the foot of the greatest of the
      beeches of Azan. That wise and brave prince of the church consented with
      words of tender consolation, and promised his aid in the pursuit of the
      criminals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eminence,&rdquo; she said, weeping, &ldquo;you are very good to me. God will reward
      you. He is just. He will repay. But my heart's desire is to follow my
      husband's dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the body of the old botanist was brought back to the shadow of the
      great beech-trees, and was buried there, like the bones of a martyr,
      within the sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this the end of the story?
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can say?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is written also, among the records of Belgium, that the faithful
      forester disappeared mysteriously a few weeks later. His body was found in
      the forest and laid near his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another record tells of the trial of Prince Barenberg and Count Ludra
      before a court martial, The count was sentenced to ten years of labor <i>on
      his own estate.</i> The death-sentence of the prince was commuted to
      imprisonment <i>in some unnamed place.</i> So far the story of German
      justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of the other kind of justice&mdash;the poetic, the Divine&mdash;the
      record is not yet complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know only that there is a fatherless girl working and praying in a
      hospital in England, and a fatherless boy fighting and praying in the
      muddy trenches near Ypres, and a lonely woman walking and praying under
      certain great beech-trees at the Chateau d'Azan. The burden of their
      prayer is the same. Night and day it rises to Him who will judge the world
      in righteousness and before whose eyes the wicked shall not stand.
    </p>

    <h2>
      THE KING'S HIGH WAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the last remnant of Belgium, a corner yet unconquered by the German
      horde, I saw a tall young man walking among the dunes, between the sodden
      lowland and the tumbling sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hills where he trod were of sand heaped high by the western winds; and
      the growth over them was wire-grass and thistles, bayberry and golden
      broom and stunted pine, with many humble wild flowers&mdash;things of no
      use, yet beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky above was gray; the northern sea was gray; the southern fields
      were hazy gray over green; the smoke of shells bursting in the air was
      gray. Gray was the skeleton of the ruined city in the distance; gray were
      the shattered spires and walls of a dozen hamlets on the horizon; gray,
      the eyes of the young man who walked in faded blue uniform, in the remnant
      of Belgium. But there was an indomitable light in his eyes, by which I
      knew that he was a King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am sure that you are his Majesty, the King of Belgium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, and a pleasant smile relaxed his tired face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, monsieur,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but you make the usual mistake in my
      title. If I were only 'the King of Belgium,' you see, I should have but a
      poor kingdom now&mdash;only this narrow strip of earth, perhaps four
      hundred square miles of debris, just a <i>'pou sto,''</i> a place to stand,
      enough to fight on, and if need be to die in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand swept around the half-circle of dull landscape visible southward
      from the top of the loftiest dune, the <i>Hooge Blikker.</i> It was a land
      of slow-winding streams and straight canals and flat fields, with here and
      there a clump of woods or a slight rise of ground, but for the most part
      level and monotonous, a checker-board landscape&mdash;stretching away
      until the eyes rested on the low hills beyond Ypres. Now all the placid
      charm of Flemish fertility as gone from the land&mdash;it was scarred and
      marred and pitted. The shells and mines had torn holes in it; the trenches
      and barbed-wire entanglements spread over it like a network of scars and
      welts; the trees were smashed into kindling-wood; the farmhouses were
      heaps of charred bricks; the shattered villages were like mouths full of
      broken teeth. As the King looked round at all this, his face darkened and
      the slight droop of his shoulders grew more marked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, no,&rdquo; he said, turning to me again, &ldquo;that is not my kingdom. My real
      title, monsieur, is <i>King of the Belgians.</i> It was for their honor,
      for their liberty, that I was willing to lose my land and risk my crown.
      While they live and hold true, I stand fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then ran swiftly through me the thought, of how the little Belgian army
      had fought, how the Belgian people had suffered, rather than surrender the
      independence of their country to the barbarians. The German cannonade was
      roaring along the Yser a few miles away; the air trembled with the
      overload of sound; but between the peals of thunder I could hear the brave
      song of the skylark climbing his silver stairway of music, undismayed,
      hopeful, unconquerable. I remembered how the word of this quiet man beside
      whom I stood had been the inspiration and encouragement of his people
      through the fierce conflict, the long agony: <i>&ldquo;I have faith in our
      destiny; a nation which defends itself does not perish; God will be with
      us in that just cause.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you have a glorious kingdom which shall never be taken
      away. But as for your land, the fates have been against you. How will you
      ever get back to it? The Germans are strong as iron and they bar the way.
      Will you make a peace with them and take what they have so often offered
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he answered calmly; &ldquo;that is not the way home, it is the way to
      dishonor. When God brings me back, my army and my Queen are going with me
      to liberate our people. There is only one way that leads there&mdash;the
      King's high way. Look, <i>monsieur,</i> you can see the beginning of it
      down there. I hope you wish me well on that road, for I shall never take
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he bade me good afternoon very courteously and walked away among the
      dunes to his little cottage at La Panne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking down through the light haze of evening I saw a strip of the
      straight white road leading eastward across the level land. At the
      beginning of it there was a broken bridge; in places it seemed torn up by
      shells; it disappeared in the violet dusk. But as I looked a vision came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridge is restored, the road mended and built up, and on that highway
      rides the King in his faded uniform with the Queen in white beside him. At
      their approach ruined villages rejoice aloud and ancient towns break forth
      into singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Bruges the royal comrades stand beside the gigantic monument in the
      centre of the Great Market, and above the shouting of the multitude the
      music of the old belfry floats unheard. Ghent and Antwerp have put on
      their glad raiment, and in their crooked streets and crowded squares joy
      flows like a river surging as it goes. Into Brussels I see this man and
      woman ride through a welcome that rises around them like the voice of many
      waters&mdash;the welcome of those who have waited and suffered, the
      welcome of those to whom liberty and honor were more dear than life. In
      the <i>Grande Place,</i> the antique, carven, gabled houses are gay with
      fluttering banners; the people delivered from the cruel invader sing
      lustily the <i>Marseillaise</i> and the old songs of Belgium.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst, Albert and Elizabeth sit quietly upon their horses. They
      have come home. Not by the low road of cowardly surrender; not by the
      crooked road of compromise and falsehood; not by the soft road of ease and
      self-indulgence; but by the straight road of faith and courage and
      self-sacrifice&mdash;the King's High Way.

    <h2>
      THE TRAITOR IN THE HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Guest, who came from beyond the lake, had lived in the house for years
      and had the freedom of it, so that he had become quite like a member of
      the family. He was friendly treated and well lodged. Indeed, some thought
      he had the best room of all, for though it was in the wing, it was
      spacious and well warmed, and had a side door, so that he could go in and
      out freely by day or night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be said that he had earned his living on the place, being
      industrious and useful, a very handy man about the house; and the children
      had a liking for him because he sang merry songs and told beautiful
      fairy-tales.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was all the more surprised and aggrieved when the Master of the
      house said to him one night, as they sat late by the fire:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of what?&rdquo; cried the Guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of caring more for the house that you came from than for the house that
      you live in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know I was at home there once,&rdquo; said the Guest, &ldquo;would you have
      me forget that? Surely you will not deny me the freedom of my thoughts and
      memories and fond feelings. Would you make me less than a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Master, &ldquo;but I will ask you to choose between your old home
      and your new home now. The house in which you lived formerly is become our
      enemy&mdash;a nest of brigands and bloody men. They have killed a child of
      ours on the highway. They threaten us to-night with an attack in force.
      Tell me plainly where you stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Guest looked down his nose toward the smouldering embers of the fire.
      He knocked out the dottle of his pipe on one of the andirons. Two fat
      tears rolled down his cheeks; he was very sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am with you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Master, &ldquo;now let us make the house fast!&rdquo; {Illustration
      with caption: 'I will ask you to choose between your old home and your new
      home now.'}
    </p>
    <p>
      So they closed and barred the shutters and locked and bolted the front
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they lighted their bedroom candles and bade each other good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the Guest went along his dim corridor, the Master turned and
      followed him very softly on tiptoe, watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the house, in the darkness, there was a sound of many shuffling
      feet and whispering voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Guest came to the side door he tried the latch, to see that it
      was working freely. He moved the bolt, not forward into its socket, but
      backward so that it should be no hindrance. In the window beside the
      doorway he set his candle. So the house was ready for late-comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Guest sighed a little. &ldquo;They are my old friends,&rdquo; he murmured,
      &ldquo;my dear old friends! I could not leave them out in the cold. I am not
      responsible for what they do. Only I must my old affection prove.&rdquo; So he
      sighed again and turned softly to his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he turned the Master stood before him and took him by the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You would betray the innocent. Already your soul is
      stained with my sleeping children's blood.&rdquo; And with his hands he choked
      the false Guest to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he shot the bolt of the side door, and barred the window, and called
      the servants, and made ready to defend the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was the fighting that night. In the morning, when the robbers were
      driven off, the false Guest was buried, outside the garden, in an unmarked
      grave.

    <h2>
      JUSTICE OF THE ELEMENTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      So the Criminal with a Crown came to the end of his resources. He had told
      his last lie, but not even his servants would believe it. He had made his
      last threat, but no living soul feared it. He had put forth his last
      stroke of violence and cruelty, but it fell short.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw his own image reflected in the eyes of men, and knew what he
      had done to the world and what had come of his evil design, he was afraid,
      and cried, &ldquo;Let the Earth swallow me!&rdquo; And the Earth opened, and swallowed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But so great was the harm that he had wrought upon the Earth, and so
      deeply had he drenched it with blood, that it could not contain him. So
      the Earth opened again, and spewed him forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he cried, &ldquo;Let the Sea hide me!&rdquo; And the waves rolled over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Sea, whereon he had wrought iniquity, and filled the depths
      thereof with the bones of the innocent, could not endure him and threw him
      up on the shore as refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he cried, &ldquo;Let the Air carry me away!&rdquo; And the strong winds blew, and
      lifted him up so that he felt exalted.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the pure Air, wherein he had let loose the vultures of hate, dropping
      death upon helpless women and harmless babes, found the burden and the
      stench of him intolerable, and let him fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he was falling he cried, &ldquo;Let the Fire give me a refuge!&rdquo; So the
      Fire, wherewith he had consumed the homes of men, rejoiced; and the flames
      which he had compelled to do his will in wickedness leaped up as he drew
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome, old master!&rdquo; roared the Fire. &ldquo;Be my slave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he perceived that there was no hope for him in the justice of the
      elements. And he said, &ldquo;I will seek mercy of Him against whom I have most
      offended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he fled to the foot of the Great White Throne. And as he kneeled there,
      broken and abased, the world was silent, waiting for the sentence of the
      Judge of All.

    <h2>
      ASHES OF VENGEANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dun was a hard little city, proud and harsh; but impregnable because it
      was built upon a high rock. The host of the Visigoths had besieged it for
      months in vain. Then came a fugitive from the city, at midnight, to the
      tent of Alaric, the Chief of the besiegers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was haggard and torn. His eyes were wild, his hands trembling. The
      Chief held and steadied him with a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Your name, the purpose that brings you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;is the Avenger. For thirty years I have lived in
      Dun, and the people have been unjust and cruel to me. They persecuted my
      family, because they hated me. My wife died of a broken heart, my children
      of starvation. I have just escaped from the prison of Dun, and come to
      tell you how the city may be taken. There is a secret pathway, a hidden
      entrance. I know it and can reveal it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Chief, measuring the man with tranquil eyes, &ldquo;but what is
      your price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vengeance,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I ask only the right to revenge my sufferings
      upon those who have inflicted them, when you have taken the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alaric bent his head and was silent for a moment. &ldquo;It is a fair price,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;and I will pay it. Tell me the way to take the city, and I will
      leave at your command a troop of soldiers sufficient to work your will on
      it afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      The trumpet sounded the capture of the city in the morning. The Avenger,
      waking late from his troubled sleep, led his soldiers through the open
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a city of the dead, and the bodies of those who had been
      killed in the last defense, lay where they had fallen. Empty and silent
      were the streets where lie had so often walked in humiliation. Gone were
      the familiar faces that had frowned on him and mocked him. The houses at
      whose doors he had often knocked were vacant. His wrath sank within him,
      and the arrow of solitude pierced him to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he came to the belfry, and there was the bell-ringer, one of the
      worst of his ancient persecutors, standing at the entrance of the tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; said the Avenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the orders of King Alaric,&rdquo; answered the bell-ringer, &ldquo;to ring the
      bells when peace comes to the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring now,&rdquo; said the Avenger, &ldquo;ring now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, at the sound of the bells, the people who had concealed themselves
      at Alaric's command came trooping forth from the cellars and caves where
      they had been hiding,&mdash;old men and women and children, a motley
      throng of sufferers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Avenger looked at them and the tears ran down his cheeks, because he
      remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don't be afraid. These soldiers are going on to join
      their army. You have done me great wrong. But the fire of hatred is burnt
      out, and in the ashes of vengeance we are going to plant the seeds of
      peace.&rdquo;

      I. THE MEETING AT THE SPRING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Along the old Roman road that crosses the rolling hills from the upper
      waters of the Marne to the Meuse a soldier of France was passing in the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the broader pools of summer moonlight he showed as a hale and husky
      fellow of about thirty years, with dark hair and eyes and a handsome,
      downcast face. His uniform was faded and dusty; not a trace of the horizon
      blue was left, only a gray shadow. He had no knapsack on his back, no gun
      on his shoulder. Wearily and doggedly he plodded his way, without eyes for
      the veiled beauty of the sleeping country. The quick, firm military step
      was gone. He trudged like a tramp, choosing always the darker side of the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a figure of flight, a broken soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the road led him into a thick forest of oaks and beeches, and so
      to the crest of a hill overlooking a long open valley with wooded heights
      beyond. Below him was the pointed spire of some temple or shrine, lying at
      the edge of the wood, with no houses near it. Farther down he could see a
      cluster of white houses with the tower of a church in the centre. Other
      villages were dimly visible up and down the valley on either slope. The
      cattle were lowing from the barnyards. The cocks crowed for the dawn.
      Already the moon had sunk behind the western trees. But the valley was
      still bathed in its misty, vanishing light. Over the eastern ridge the
      gray glimmer of the little day was rising, faintly tinged with rose. It
      was time for the broken soldier to seek his covert and rest till night
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he stepped aside from the road and found a little dell thick with
      underwoods, and in it a clear spring gurgling among the ferns and mosses.
      Around the opening grew wild gooseberries and golden broom and a few tall
      spires of purple foxglove. He drew off his dusty boots and socks and
      bathed his feet in a small pool, drying them with fern leaves. Then he
      took a slice of bread and a piece of cheese from his pocket and made his
      breakfast. Going to the edge of the thicket, he parted the branches and
      peered out over the vale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its eaves sloped gently to the level floor where the river loitered in
      loops and curves. The sun was just topping the eastern hills; the heads of
      the trees were dark against a primrose sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fields the hay had been cut and gathered. The aftermath was already
      greening the moist places. Cattle and sheep sauntered out to pasture. A
      thin silvery mist floated here and there, spreading in broad sheets over
      the wet ground and shredding into filmy scarves and ribbons as the breeze
      caught it among the pollard willows and poplars on the border of the
      stream. Far away the water glittered where the river made a sudden bend or
      a long smooth reach. It was like the flashing of distant shields. Overhead
      a few white clouds climbed up from the north. The rolling ridges, one
      after another, enfolded the valley as far as eye could see; dark green set
      in pale green, with here and there an arm of forest running down on a
      sharp promontory to meet and turn the meandering stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be the valley of the Meuse,&rdquo; said the soldier. &ldquo;My faith, but
      France is beautiful and tranquil here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The northerly wind was rising. The clouds climbed more swiftly. The
      poplars shimmered, the willows glistened, the veils of mist vanished. From
      very far away there came a rumbling thunder, heavy, insistent, continuous,
      punctuated with louder crashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the guns,&rdquo; muttered the soldier, shivering. &ldquo;It is the guns around
      Verdun! Those damned Boches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned back into the thicket and dropped among the ferns beside the
      spring. Stretching himself with a gesture of abandon, he pillowed his face
      on his crossed arms to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rustling in the bushes roused him. He sprang to his feet quickly. It was
      a priest, clad in a dusty cassock, his long black beard streaked with
      gray. He came slowly treading up beside the trickling rivulet, carrying a
      bag on a stick over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, my son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have chosen a pleasant spot to
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier, startled, but not forgetting his manners learned from
      boyhood, stood up and lifted his hand to take off his cap. It was already
      lying on the ground. &ldquo;Good morning, Father,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I did not
      choose the place, but stumbled on it by chance. It is pleasant enough, for
      I am very tired and have need of sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;I can see that you look weary, and I beg you
      to pardon me if I have interrupted your repose. But why do you say you
      came here 'by chance'? If you are a good Christian you know that nothing
      is by chance. All is ordered and designed by Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they told me in church long ago,&rdquo; said the soldier coldly; &ldquo;but now it
      does not seem so true&mdash;at least not with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first feeling of friendliness and respect into which he had been
      surprised was passing. He had fallen back into the mood of his journey&mdash;mistrust,
      secrecy, resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest caught the tone. His gray eyes under their bushy brows looked
      kindly but searchingly at the soldier and smiled a little. He set down his
      bag and leaned on his stick. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can tell you one thing,
      my son. At all events it was not chance that brought me here. I came with
      a purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier started a little, stung by suspicion. &ldquo;What then,&rdquo; he cried,
      roughly, &ldquo;were you looking for me? What do you know of me? What is this
      talk of chance and purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said the priest, his smile spreading from his eyes to his
      lips, &ldquo;do not be angry. I assure you that I know nothing of you whatever,
      not even your name nor why you are here. When I said that I came with a
      purpose I meant only that a certain thought, a wish, led me to this spot.
      Let us sit together awhile beside the spring and make better
      acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not desire it,&rdquo; said the soldier, with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will not refuse it?&rdquo; queried the priest gently. &ldquo;It is not good
      to refuse the request of one old enough to be your father. Look, I have
      here some excellent tobacco and cigarette-papers. Let us sit down and
      smoke together. I will tell you who I am and the purpose that brought me
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier yielded grudgingly, not knowing what else to do. They sat down
      on a mossy bank beside the spring, and while the blue smoke of their
      cigarettes went drifting under the little trees the priest began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Antoine Courcy. I am the cure of Darney, a village among the
      Reaping Hook Hills, a few leagues south from here. For twenty-five years I
      have reaped the harvest of heaven in that blessed little field. I am sorry
      to leave it. But now this war, this great battle for freedom and the life
      of France, calls me. It is a divine vocation. France has need of all her
      sons to-day, even the old ones. I cannot keep the love of God in my heart
      unless I follow the love of country in my life. My younger brother, who
      used to be the priest of the next parish to mine, was in the army. He has
      fallen. I am going to replace him. I am on my way to join the troops&mdash;as
      a chaplain, if they will; if not, then as a private. I must get into the
      army of France or be left out of the host of heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier had turned his face away and was plucking the lobes from a
      frond of fern. &ldquo;A brave resolve, Father,&rdquo; he said, with an ironic note.
      &ldquo;But you have not yet told me what brings you off your road, to this
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; replied the priest eagerly; &ldquo;it is the love of Jeanne
      d'Arc, the Maid who saved France long ago. You know about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little,&rdquo; nodded the soldier. &ldquo;I have learned in the school. She was a
      famous saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet a saint,&rdquo; said the priest earnestly; &ldquo;the Pope has not yet
      pronounced her a saint. But it will be done soon. Already he has declared
      her among the Blessed Ones. To me she is the most blessed of all. She
      never thought of herself or of a saint's crown. She gave her life entire
      for France. And this is the place that she came from! Think of that&mdash;right
      here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that,&rdquo; said the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes,&rdquo; the priest went on, kindling. &ldquo;I tell you it was here that the
      Maid of France received her visions and set out to her work. You see that
      village below us&mdash;look out through the branches&mdash;that is
      Domremy, where she was born. That spire just at the edge of the wood&mdash;you
      saw that? It is the basilica they have built to her memory. It is full of
      pictures of her. It stands where the old beech-tree, 'Fair May,' used to
      grow. There she heard the voices and saw the saints who sent her on her
      mission. And this is the Gooseberry Spring, the Well of the Good Fairies.
      Here she came with the other children, at the festival of the
      well-dressing, to spread their garlands around it, and sing, and cat their
      supper on the green. Heavenly voices spoke to her, but the others did not
      hear them. Often did she drink of this water. It became a fountain of life
      springing up in her heart. I have come to drink at the same source. It
      will strengthen me as a sacrament. Come, son, let us take it together as
      we go to our duty in battle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Courcy stood up and opened his old black bag. He took out a small
      metal cup. He filled it carefully at the spring. He made the sign of the
      cross over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; he murmured,
      &ldquo;blessed and holy is this water.&rdquo; Then he held the cup toward the soldier.
      &ldquo;Come, let us share it and make our vows together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bright drops trembled and fell from the bottom of the cup. The soldier
      sat still, his head in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered heavily, &ldquo;I cannot take it. I am not worthy. Can a man
      take a sacrament without confessing his sins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Courcy looked at him with pitying eyes. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;I
      see, my son. You have a burden on your heart. Well, I will stay with you
      and try to lift it. But first I shall make my own vow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised the cup toward the sky. A tiny brown wren sang canticles of
      rapture in the thicket. A great light came into the priest's face&mdash;a
      sun-ray from the east, far beyond the treetops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed Jeanne d'Arc, I drink from thy fountain in thy name. I vow my
      life to thy cause. Aid me, aid this my son, to fight valiantly for freedom
      and for France. In the name of God, Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier looked up at him. Wonder, admiration, and shame were
      struggling in the look. Father Courcy wiped the empty cup carefully and
      put it back in his bag. Then he sat down beside the soldier, laying a
      fatherly hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my son, you shall tell me what is on your heart.&rdquo;

      II. THE GREEN CONFESSIONAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a long time the soldier remained silent. His head was bowed. His
      shoulders drooped. His hands trembled between his knees. He was wrestling
      with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he cried, at last, &ldquo;I cannot, I dare not tell you. Unless, perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;his
      voice faltered&mdash;&ldquo;you could receive it under the seal of confession?
      But no. How could you do that? Here in the green woods? In the open air,
      beside a spring? Here is no confessional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Father Courcy. &ldquo;It is a good place, a holy place. Heaven
      is over our heads and very near. I will receive your confession here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier knelt among the flowers. The priest pronounced the sacred
      words. The soldier began his confession:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Pierre Duval, a great sinner, confess my fault, my most grievous
      fault, and pray for pardon.&rdquo; He stopped for a moment and then continued,
      &ldquo;But first I must tell you, Father, just who I am and where I come from
      and what brings me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Pierre Duval, go on. That is what I am waiting to hear. Be simple
      and very frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I am from the parish of Laucourt, in the pleasant country of
      the Barrois not far from Bar-sur-Aube. My word, but that is a pretty land,
      full of orchards and berry-gardens! Our old farm there is one of the
      prettiest and one of the best, though it is small. It was hard to leave it
      when the call to the colors came, two years ago. But I was glad to go. My
      heart was high and strong for France. I was in the Nth Infantry, We were
      in the centre division under General Foch at the battle of the Marne. <i>Fichtre!</i>
      but that was fierce fighting! And what a general! He did not know how to
      spell 'defeat.' He wrote it 'victory.' Four times we went across that
      cursed Marsh of St.-Gond. The dried mud was trampled full of dead bodies.
      The trickling streams of water ran red. Four times we were thrown back by
      the boches. You would have thought that was enough. But the general did
      not think so. We went over again on the fifth day, and that time we
      stayed. The Germans could not stand against us. They broke and ran. The
      roads where we chased them were full of empty wine-bottles. In one village
      we caught three officers and a dozen men dead drunk. <i>Bigre!</i> what a
      fine joke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre, leaning back upon his heels, was losing himself in his recital.
      His face lighted up, his hands were waving. Father Courcy bent forward
      with shining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Continue,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This is a beautiful confession&mdash;no sin yet.
      Continue, Pierre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, after that we were fighting here and there, on the Aisne, on
      the Ailette, everywhere. Always the same story&mdash;Germans rolling down
      on us in flood, green-gray waves. But the foam on them was fire and steel.
      The shells of the barrage swept us like hailstones. We waited, waited in
      our trenches, till the green-gray mob was near enough. Then the word came.
      <i>Sapristi!</i> We let loose with mitrailleuse, rifle, field-gun,
      everything that would throw death. It did not seem like fighting with men.
      It was like trying to stop a monstrous thing, a huge, terrible mass that
      was rushing on to overwhelm us. The waves tumbled and broke before they
      reached us. Sometimes they fell flat. Sometimes they turned and rushed the
      other way. It was wild, wild, like a change of the wind and tide in a
      storm, everything torn and confused. Then perhaps the word came to go over
      the top and at them. That was furious. That was fighting with men, for
      sure&mdash;bayonet, revolver, rifle-butt, knife, anything that would kill.
      Often I sickened at the blood and the horror of it. But something inside
      of me shouted: 'Fight on! It is for France. It is for &ldquo;L'Alouette&rdquo; thy
      farm; for thy wife, thy little ones. Will you let them be ruined by those
      beasts of Germans? What are they doing here on French soil? Brigands,
      butchers, apaches! Drive them out; and if they will not go, kill them so
      they can do no more shameful deeds. Fight on!' So I killed all I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest nodded his head grimly. &ldquo;You were right, Pierre; your voice
      spoke true. It was a dreadful duty that you were doing. The Gospel tells
      us if we are smitten on one cheek we must turn the other. But it does not
      tell us to turn the cheek of a little child, of the woman we love, the
      country we belong to. No! that would be disgraceful, wicked, un-Christian.
      It would be to betray the innocent! Continue, my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Pierre went on, his voice deepening and his face growing
      more tense, &ldquo;then we were sent to Verdun. That was the hottest place of
      all. It was at the top of the big German drive. The whole sea rushed and
      fell on us&mdash;big guns, little guns, poison-gas, hand-grenades, liquid
      fire, bayonets, knives, and trench-clubs. Fort after fort went down. The
      whole pack of hell was loose and raging. I thought of that crazy, chinless
      Crown Prince sitting in his safe little cottage hidden in the woods
      somewhere&mdash;they say he had flowers and vines planted around it&mdash;drinking
      stolen champagne and sicking on his dogs of death. He was in no danger. I
      cursed him in my heart, that blood-lord! The shells rained on Verdun. The
      houses were riddled; the cathedral was pierced in a dozen places; a
      hundred fires broke out. The old citadel held good. The outer forts to the
      north and east were taken. Only the last ring was left. We common soldiers
      did not know much about what was happening. The big battle was beyond our
      horizon. But that General Petain, he knew it all. Ah, that is a wise man,
      I can tell you! He sent us to this place or that place where the defense
      was most needed. We went gladly, without fear or holding back. We were
      resolute that those mad dogs should not get through. <i>'They shall not
      pass'!</i> And they did not pass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glorious!&rdquo; cried the priest, drinking the story in. &ldquo;And you, Pierre?
      Where were you, what were you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at Douaumont, that fort on the highest hill of all. The Germans
      took it. It cost them ten thousand men. The ground around it was like a
      wood-yard piled with logs. The big shell-holes were full of corpses. There
      were a few of us that got away. Then our company was sent to hold the
      third redoubt on the slope in front of Port de Vaux. Perhaps you have
      heard of that redoubt. That was a bitter job. But we held it many days and
      nights. The boches pounded us from Douaumont and from the village of Vaux.
      They sent wave after wave up the slope to drive us out. But we stuck to
      it. That ravine of La Caillette was a boiling caldron of men. It bubbled
      over with smoke and fire. Once, when their second wave had broken just in
      front of us, we went out to hurry the fragments down the hill. Then the
      guns from Douaumont and the village of Vaux hammered us. Our men fell like
      ninepins. Our lieutenant called to us to turn back. Just then a shell tore
      away his right leg at the knee. It hung by the skin and tendons. He was a
      brave lad. I could not leave him to die there. So I hoisted him on my
      back. Three shots struck me. They felt just like hard blows from a heavy
      fist. One of them made my left arm powerless. I sank my teeth in the
      sleeve of my lieutenant's coat as it hung over my shoulder. I must not let
      him fall off my back. Somehow&mdash;God knows how&mdash;I gritted through
      to our redoubt. They took my lieutenant from my shoulders. And then the
      light went out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest leaned forward, his hands stretched out around the soldier.
      &ldquo;But you are a hero,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let me embrace you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier drew back, shaking his head sadly. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, his voice
      breaking&mdash;&ldquo;no, my Father, you must not embrace me now. I may have
      been a brave man once. But now I am a coward. Let me tell you everything.
      My wounds were bad, but not desperate. The <i>brancardiers</i> carried me
      down to Verdun, at night I suppose, but I was unconscious; and so to the
      hospital at Vaudelaincourt. There were days and nights of blankness mixed
      with pain. Then I came to my senses and had rest. It was wonderful. I
      thought that I had died and gone to heaven. Would God it had been so! Then
      I should have been with my lieutenant. They told me he had passed away in
      the redoubt. But that hospital was beautiful, so clean and quiet and
      friendly. Those white nurses were angels. They handled me like a baby. I
      would have liked to stay there. I had no desire to get better. But I did.
      One day several officers visited the hospital. They came to my cot, where
      I was sitting up. The highest of them brought out a Cross of War and
      pinned it on the breast of my nightshirt. 'There,' he said, 'you are
      decorated, Pierre Duval! You are one of the heroes of France. You are soon
      going to be perfectly well and to fight again bravely for your country.' I
      thanked him, but I knew better. My body might get perfectly well, but
      something in my soul was broken. It was worn out. The thin spring had
      snapped. I could never fight again. Any loud noise made me shake all over.
      I knew that I could never face a battle&mdash;impossible! I should
      certainly lose my nerve and run away. It is a damned feeling, that broken
      something inside of one. I can't describe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre stopped for a moment and moistened his dry lips with the tip of his
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Father Courcy. &ldquo;I understand perfectly what you want to
      say. It was like being lost and thinking that nothing could save you; a
      feeling that is piercing and dull at the same time, like a heavy weight
      pressing on you with sharp stabs in it. It was what they call shell-shock,
      a terrible thing. Sometimes it drives men crazy for a while. But the
      doctors know what to do for that malady. It passes. You got over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Pierre, &ldquo;the doctors may not have known that I had it. At
      all events, they did not know what to do for it. It did not pass. It grew
      worse. But I hid it, talking very little, never telling anybody how I
      felt. They said I was depressed and needed cheering up. All the while
      there was that black snake coiled around my heart, squeezing tighter and
      tighter. But my body grew stronger every day. The wounds were all healed.
      I was walking around. In July the doctor-in-chief sent for me to his
      office. He said: 'You are cured, Pierre Duval, but you are not yet fit to
      fight. You are low in your mind. You need cheering up. You are to have a
      month's furlough and repose. You shall go home to your farm. How is it
      that you call it?' I suppose I had been babbling about it in my sleep and
      one of the nurses had told him. He was always that way, that little Doctor
      Roselly, taking an interest in the men, talking with them and acting
      friendly. I said the farm was called <i>'L'Alouette''</i>&mdash;rather a
      foolish name. 'Not, at all,' he answered; 'it is a fine name, with the
      song of a bird in it. Well, you are going back to <i>&ldquo;L'Alouette&rdquo;</i> to
      hear the lark sing for a month, to kiss your wife and your children, to
      pick gooseberries and currants. Eh, my boy, what do you think of that?
      Then, when the month is over, you will be a new man. You will be ready to
      fight again at Verdun. Remember they have not passed and they shall not
      pass! Good luck to you, Pierre Duval.' So I went back to the farm as fast
      as I could go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a few moments, letting his thoughts wander through the
      pleasant paths of that little garden of repose. His eyes were dreaming,
      his lips almost smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was sweet at <i>'L'Alouette,''</i> very sweet, Father. The farm was in
      pretty good order and the kitchen-garden was all right, though, the
      flowers had been a little neglected. You see, my wife, Josephine, she is a
      very clever woman. She had kept up the things that were the most
      necessary. She had hired one of the old neighbors and a couple of boys to
      help her with the ploughing and planting. The harvest she sold as it
      stood. Our yoke of cream-colored oxen and the roan horse were in good
      condition. Little Pierrot, who is five, and little Josette, who is three,
      were as brown as berries. They hugged me almost to death. But it was
      Josephine herself who was the best of all. She is only twenty-six, Father,
      and so beautiful still, with her long chestnut hair and her eyes like
      stones shining under the waters of a brook. I tell you it was good to get
      her in my arms again and feel her lips on mine. And to wake in the early
      morning, while the birds were singing, and see her face beside me on the
      white pillow, sleeping like a child, that was a little bit of Paradise.
      But I do wrong to tell you of all this, Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed, my big boy,&rdquo; nodded the priest. &ldquo;You are saying nothing wrong. I
      was a man before I was a priest. It is all natural, what you are saying,
      and all according to God's law&mdash;no sin in it. Proceed. Did your
      happiness do you good?&rdquo; Pierre shook his head doubtfully. The look of
      dejection came back to his face. He frowned as if something puzzled and
      hurt him. &ldquo;Yes and no. That is the strange thing. It made me thankful&mdash;that
      goes without saying. But it did not make me any stronger in my heart.
      Perhaps it was too sweet. I thought too much of it. I could not bear to
      think of anything else. The idea of the war was hateful, horrible,
      disgusting. The noise and the dirt of it, the mud in the autumn and the
      bitter cold in the winter, the rats and the lice in the dugouts, And then
      the fury of the charge, and the everlasting killing, killing, or being
      killed! The danger had seemed little or nothing to me when I was there.
      But at a distance it was frightful, unendurable. I knew that I could never
      stand up to it again. Besides, already I had done my share&mdash;enough
      for two or three men. Why must I go back into that hell? It was not fair.
      Life was too dear to be risking it all the time. I could not endure it.
      France? France? Of course I love France. But my farm and my life with
      Josephine and the children mean more to me. The thing that made me a good
      soldier is broken inside me. It is beyond mending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice sank lower and lower. Father Courcy looked at him gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your farm is a part of France. You belong to France. He that saveth
      his life shall lose it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. But my farm is such a small part of France. I am only
      one man. What difference does one man make, except to himself? Moreover, I
      had done my part, that was certain. Twenty times, really, my life had been
      lost. Why must I throw it away again? Listen, Father. There is a village
      in the Vosges, near the Swiss border, where a relative of mine lives. If I
      could get to him he would take me in and give me some other clothes and
      help me over the frontier into Switzerland. There I could change my name
      and find work until the war is over. That was my plan. So I set out on my
      journey, following the less-travelled roads, tramping by night and
      sleeping by day. Thus I came to this spring at the same time as you by
      chance, by pure chance. Do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Courcy looked very stern and seemed about to speak in anger. Then
      he shook his head, and said quietly: &ldquo;No, I do not see that at all. It
      remains to be seen whether it was by chance. But tell me more about your
      sin. Did you let your wife, Josephine, know what you were going to do? Did
      you tell her good-by, parting for Switzerland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no! I did not dare. She would never have forgiven me. So I slipped
      down to the post-office at Bar-sur-Aube and stole a telegraph blank. It
      was ten days before my furlough was out. I wrote a message to myself
      calling me back to the colors at once. I showed it to her. Then I said
      good-by. I wept. She did not cry one tear. Her eyes were stars. She
      embraced me a dozen times. She lifted up each of the children to hug me.
      Then she cried: 'Go now, my brave man. Fight well. Drive the damned boches
      out. It is for us and for France. God protect you. <i>Au revoir!''</i> I
      went down the road silent. I felt like a dog. But I could not help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were a dog,&rdquo; said the priest sternly. &ldquo;That is what you were, and
      what you remain unless you can learn to help it. You lied to your wife.
      You forged; you tricked her who trusted you. You have done the thing which
      you yourself say she would never forgive. If she loves you and prays for
      you now, you have stolen that love and that prayer. You are a thief. A
      true daughter of France could never love a coward to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; sobbed Pierre, burying his face in the weeds. &ldquo;Yet I did
      it partly for her, and I could not do otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little for her, and a hundred times for yourself,&rdquo; said the priest
      indignantly. &ldquo;Be honest. If there was a little bit of love for her, it was
      the kind of love she did not want. She would spit upon it. If you are
      going to Switzerland now you are leaving her forever. You can never go
      back to Josephine again. You are a deserter. She would cast you out,
      coward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broken soldier lay very still, almost as if he were dead. Then he rose
      slowly to his feet, with a pale, set face. He put his hand behind his back
      and drew out a revolver. &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I am a coward. But
      not altogether such a coward as you think, Father. It is not merely death
      that I fear. I could face that, I think. Here, take this pistol and shoot
      me now! No one will know. You can say you shot a deserter, or that I
      attacked you. Shoot me now, Father, and let me out of this trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Courcy looked at him with amazement. Then he took the pistol,
      uncocked it cautiously, and dropped it behind him. He turned to Pierre and
      regarded him curiously. &ldquo;Go on with your confession, Pierre. Tell me about
      this strange kind of cowardice which can face death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soldier dropped on his knees again, and went on in a low, shaken
      voice: &ldquo;It is this, Father. By my broken soul, this is the very root of
      it. I am afraid of fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest thought for an instant. &ldquo;But that is not reasonable, Pierre. It
      is nonsense. Fear cannot hurt you. If you fight it you can conquer it. At
      least you can disregard it, march through it, as if it were not there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this fear,&rdquo; argued the soldier, with a peasant's obstinacy. &ldquo;This is
      something very big and dreadful. It has no shape, but a dead-white face
      and red, blazing eyes full of hate and scorn. I have seen it in the dark.
      It is stronger than I am. Since something is broken inside of me, I know I
      can never conquer it. No, it would wrap its shapeless arms around me and
      stab me to the heart with its fiery eyes. I should turn and run in the
      middle of the battle. I should trample on my wounded comrades. I should be
      shot in the back and die in disgrace. O my God! my God! who can save me
      from this? It is horrible. I cannot bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest laid his hand gently on Pierre's quivering shoulder. &ldquo;Courage,
      my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then say to yourself that fear is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a lie. This fear is real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then cease to tremble at it; kill it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible. I am afraid of fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then carry it as your burden, your cross. Take it back to Verdun with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not. It would poison the others. It would bring me to dishonor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray to God for help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not answer me. I am a wicked man. Father, I have made my
      confession. Will you give me a penance and absolve me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise to go back to the army and fight as well as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! that is what I cannot do. My mind is shaken to pieces. Whither
      shall I turn? I can decide nothing. I am broken. I repent of my great sin.
      Father, for the love of God, speak the word of absolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre lay on his face, motionless, his arms stretched out. The priest
      rose and went to the spring. He scooped up a few drops in the hollow of
      his hand. He sprinkled it like holy water upon the soldier's head. A
      couple of tears fell with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God have pity on you, my son, and bring you back to yourself. The word of
      absolution is not for me to speak while you think of forsaking France. Put
      that thought away from you, do penance for it, and you will be absolved
      from your great sin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre turned over and lay looking up at the priest's face and at the blue
      sky with white cloude drifting across it. He sighed. &ldquo;Ah, if that could
      only be! But I have not the strength. It is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All things are possible to him that believeth. Strength will come.
      Perhaps Jeanne d'Arc herself will help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would never speak to a man like me. She is a great saint, very high
      in heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was a farmer's lass, a peasant like yourself. She would speak to you,
      gladly and kindly, if you saw her, and in your own language, too. Trust
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not know enough about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Pierre. I have thought for you. I will appoint the first part of
      your penance. You shall take the risk of being recognized and caught. You
      shall go down to the village and visit the places that belong to her&mdash;her
      basilica, her house, her church. Then you shall come back here and wait
      until you know&mdash;until you surely know what you must do. Will you
      promise this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre had risen and looked up at the priest with tear-stained face. But
      his eyes were quieter. &ldquo;Yes, Father, I can promise you this much
      faithfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I must go my way. Farewell, my son. Peace in war be with you.&rdquo; He
      held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre took it reverently. &ldquo;And with you, Father,&rdquo; he murmured.

      III. THE ABSOLVING DREAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Antoine Courcy was one of those who are fitted and trained by nature for
      the cure of souls. If you had spoken to him of psychiatry he would not
      have understood you. The long word would have been Greek to him. But the
      thing itself he knew well. The preliminary penance which he laid upon
      Pierre Duval was remedial. It belonged to the true healing art which works
      first in the spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the broken soldier went down the hill, in the blaze of the
      mid-morning sunlight, toward Domremy, there was much misgiving and
      confusion in his thoughts. He did not comprehend why he was going, except
      that he had promised. He was not sure that some one might not know him, or
      perhaps out of mere curiosity stop him and question him. It was a
      reluctant journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was in effect an unconscious pilgrimage to the one health-resort
      that his soul needed. For Domremy and the region round about are saturated
      with the most beautiful story of France. The life of Jeanne d'Arc, simple
      and mysterious, humble and glorious, most human and most heavenly, flows
      under that place like a hidden stream, rising at every turn in springs and
      fountains. The poor little village lives in and for her memory. Her
      presence haunts the ridges and the woods, treads the green pastures,
      follows the white road beside the river, and breathes in the never-resting
      valley-wind that marries the flowers in June and spreads their seed in
      August.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the small basilica built to her memory on the place where her old
      beech-tree, &ldquo;Fair May,&rdquo; used to stand, there was an ancient caretaker who
      explained to Pierre the pictures from the life of the Maid with which the
      walls are decorated. They are stiff and conventional, but the old man
      found them wonderful and told with zest the story of <i>La Pucelle</i>&mdash;how
      she saw her first vision; how she recognized the Dauphin in his palace at
      Chinon; how she broke the siege of Orleans; how she saw Charles crowned in
      the cathedral at Rheims; how she was burned at the stake in Rouen. But
      they could not kill her soul. She saved France.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the village church there was a priest from the border of Alsace, also a
      pilgrim like Pierre, but one who knew the shrine better. He showed the
      difference between the new and the old parts of the building. Certain
      things the Maid herself had seen and touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the old holy-water basin, an antique, broken column hollowed out
      on top. Here her fingers must have rested often. Before this ancient
      statue of St. Michel she must have often knelt to say her prayers. The
      cure of the parish was a friend of hers and loved to talk with her. She
      was a good girl, devout and obedient, not learned, but a holy and great
      soul. She saved France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the house where she was born and passed her childhood a crippled old
      woman was custodian. It was a humble dwelling of plastered stone standing
      between two tall fir-trees, with ivy growing over the walls, lilies and
      hollyhocks blooming in the garden. Pierre found it not half so good a
      house as <i>&ldquo;L'Alouette.&rdquo;</i> But to the custodian it was more precious
      than a palace. In this upper room with its low mullioned window the Maid
      began her life. Here, in the larger room below, is the kneeling statue
      which the Princess Marie d'Orleans made of her. Here, to the right, under
      the sloping roof, with its worm-eaten beams, she slept and prayed and
      worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, here is the bread-board between two timbers where she cut the bread
      for the <i>croute au pot.</i> From this small window she looked at night
      and saw the sanctuary light burning in the church. Here, also, as well as
      in the garden and in the woods, her heavenly voices spoke to her and told
      her what she must do for her king and her country. She was not afraid or
      ashamed, though she lived in so small a house. Here in this very room she
      braided her hair and put on her red dress, and set forth on foot for her
      visit to Robert de Baudricourt at Vaucouleurs. He was a rough man and at
      first he received her roughly. But at last she convinced him. He gave her
      a horse and arms and sent her to the king. She saved France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the rustic inn Pierre ate thick slices of dark bread and drank a stoup
      of thin red wine at noon. He sat at a bare table in the corner of the
      room. Behind him, at a table covered with a white cloth, two captains on
      furlough had already made their breakfast. They also were pilgrims, drawn
      to Domremy by the love of Jeanne d'Arc. They talked of nothing else but of
      her. Yet their points of view were absolutely different.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them, the younger, was short and swarthy, a Savoyard, the son of an
      Italian doctor at St. Jean de Maurienne. He was a sceptic; he believed in
      Jeanne, but not in the legends about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said he eagerly, &ldquo;she was one of the greatest among women.
      But all that about her 'voices' was illusion. The priests suggested it.
      She had hallucinations. Remember her age when they began&mdash;just
      thirteen. She was clever and strong; doubtless she was pretty; certainly
      she was very courageous. She was only a girl. But she had a big, brave
      idea which possessed her&mdash;the liberation of her country. Pure? Yes. I
      am sure she was virtuous. Otherwise the troops would not have followed and
      obeyed her as they did. Soldiers are very quick about those things. They
      recognize and respect an honest woman. Several men were in love with her,
      I think. But she was <i>une nature froide.</i> The only thing that moved
      her was her big, brave idea&mdash;to save France. The Maid was a mother,
      but not of a mortal child. Her offspring was the patriotism of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other captain was a man of middle age, from Lyons, the son of an
      architect. He was tall and pale and his large brown eyes had the
      tranquillity of a devout faith in them. He argued with quiet tenacity for
      his convictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right to believe in her,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I think you are mistaken
      to deny her 'voices.' They were as real as anything in her life. You
      credit her when she says that she was born here, that she went to Chinon
      and saw the king, that delivered Orleans. Why not credit her when she says
      she heard God and the saints speaking to her? The proof of it was in what
      she did. Have you read the story of her trial? How clear and steady her
      answers were! The judges could not shake her. Yet at any moment she could
      have saved her life by denying the 'voices.' It was because she knew,
      because she was sure, that she could not deny. Her vision was a part of
      her real life. She was the mother of French patriotism&mdash;yes. But she
      was also the daughter of true faith. That was her power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the younger man, &ldquo;she sacrificed herself and she saved
      France. That was the great thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the elder man, stretching his hand across the table to clasp
      the hand of his companion, &ldquo;there is nothing greater than that. If we do
      that, God will forgive us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They put on their caps to go. Pierre rose and stood at attention. They
      returned his salute with a friendly smile and passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments he finished his bread and wine, paid his score, and
      followed them. He watched them going down the village street toward the
      railway station. Then he turned and walked slowly back to the spring in
      the dell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was hot, in spite of the steady breeze which came out of the
      north. The air felt as if it had passed through a furnace. The low,
      continuous thunder of the guns rolled up from Verdun, with now and then a
      sharper clap from St. Mihiel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre was very tired. His head was heavy, his heart troubled. He lay down
      among the ferns, looking idly at the foxglove spires above him and turning
      over in his mind the things he had heard and seen at Domremy. Presently he
      fell into a profound sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long it was he could not tell, but suddenly he became aware of some
      one near him. He sprang up. A girl was standing beside the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore a bright-red dress and her feet were bare. Her black hair hung
      down her back. Her eyes were the color of a topaz. Her form was tall and
      straight. She carried a distaff under her arm and looked as if she had
      just come from following the sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, shepherdess,&rdquo; said Pierre. Then a strange thought struck him,
      and he fell on his knees. &ldquo;Pardon, lady,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Forgive my
      rudeness. You are of the high society of heaven, a saint. You are called
      Jeanne d'Arc?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded and smiled. &ldquo;That is my name,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Sometimes they call
      me <i>La Pucelle</i>, or the Maid of France. But you were right, I am a
      shepherdess, too. I have kept my father's sheep in the fields down there,
      and spun from the distaff while I watched them. I know how to sew and spin
      as well as any girl in the Barrois or Lorraine. Will you not stand up and
      talk with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre rose, still abashed and confused. He did not quite understand how
      to take this strange experience&mdash;too simple for a heavenly
      apparition, too real for a common dream. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you
      are a shepherdess, why are you here? There are no sheep here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yes. You are one of mine. I have come here to seek you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know me, then? How can I be one of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are a soldier of France and you are in trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre's head drooped. &ldquo;A broken soldier,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;not fit to speak
      to you. I am running away because I am afraid of fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw back her head and laughed. &ldquo;You speak very bad French. There is
      no such thing as being afraid of fear. For if you are afraid of it, you
      hate it. If you hate it, you will have nothing to do with it. And if you
      have nothing to do with it, it cannot touch you; it is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for you, a saint, it is easy to say that. You had no fear when you
      fought. You knew you would not be killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was no more sure of that than the other soldiers. Besides, when they
      bound me to the stake at Rouen and kindled the fire around me I knew very
      well that I should be killed. But there was no fear in it. Only peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you were strong, a warrior born. You were not wounded and broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four times I was wounded,&rdquo; she answered gravely. &ldquo;At Orleans a bolt went
      through my right shoulder. At Paris a lance tore my thigh. I never saw the
      blood of Frenchmen flow without feeling my heart stand still. I was not a
      warrior born. I knew not how to ride or fight. But I did it. What we must
      needs do that we can do. Soldier, do not look on the ground. Look up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a strange thing took place before his eyes. A wondrous radiance, a
      mist of light, enveloped and hid the shepherdess. When it melted she was
      clad in shining armor, sitting on a white horse, and lifting a bare sword
      in her left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God commands you,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It is for France. Be of good cheer. Do not
      retreat. The fort will soon be yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How should Pierre know that this was the cry with which the Maid had
      rallied her broken men at Orleans when the fort of <i>Les Tourelles</i>
      fell? What he did know was that something seemed to spring up within him
      to answer that call. He felt that he would rather die than desert such a
      leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure on the horse turned away as if to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not leave me,&rdquo; he cried, stretching out his hands to her. &ldquo;Stay with
      me. I will obey you joyfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned again and looked at him very earnestly. Her eyes shone deep
      into his heart. &ldquo;Here I cannot stay,&rdquo; answered a low, sweet, womanly
      voice. &ldquo;It is late, and my other children need me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But forgiveness? Can you give that to me&mdash;a coward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are no coward. Your only fault was to doubt a brave man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my wife? May I go back and tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, surely. Would you make her hear slander of the man she loves? Be what
      she believes you and she will be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the absolution, the word of peace? Will you speak that to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes shone more clearly; the voice sounded sweeter and steadier than
      ever. &ldquo;After the penance comes the absolution. You will find peace only at
      the lance's point. Son of France, go, go, go! I will help you. Go hardily
      to Verdun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre sprang forward after the receding figure, tried to clasp the knee,
      the foot of the Maid. As he fell to the ground something sharp pierced his
      hand. It must be her spur, thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was aware that his eyes were shut. He opened them and looked at
      his hand carefully. There was only a scratch on it, and a tiny drop of
      blood. He had torn it on the thorns of the wild gooseberry-bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head lay close to the clear pool of the spring. He buried his face in
      it and drank deep. Then he sprang up, shaking the drops from his mustache,
      found his cap and pistol, and hurried up the glen toward the old Roman
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of that damned foolishness about Switzerland,&rdquo; he said, aloud. &ldquo;I
      belong to France. I am going with the other boys to save her. I was born
      for that.&rdquo; He took off his cap and stood still for a moment. He spoke as
      if he were taking an oath. &ldquo;By Jeanne d'Arc!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      IV. THE VICTORIOUS PENANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It never occurred to Pierre Duval, as he trudged those long kilometres
      toward the front, that he was doing a penance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The joy of a mind made up is a potent cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greetings of comrades on the road put gladness into his heart and
      strength into his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot and dusty journey, and a sober one. But it was not a sad one.
      He was going toward that for which he was born. He was doing that which
      France asked of him, that which God told him to do. Josephine would be
      glad and proud of him. He would never be ashamed to meet her eyes. As he
      went, alone or in company with others, he whistled and sang a bit. He
      thought of <i>&ldquo;L'Alouette&rdquo;</i> a good deal. But not too much. He thought
      also of the forts of Douaumont and Vaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Dame!&rdquo;</i> he cried to himself. &ldquo;If I could help to win them back
      again! That would be fine! How sick that would make those cursed boches
      and their knock-kneed Crown Prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the little village of the headquarters behind Verdun he found many old
      friends and companions. They greeted him with cheerful irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold the prodigal! You took your time about coming back, didn't you?
      Was the hospital to your taste, the nurses pretty? How is the wife? Any
      more children? How goes it, old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more children yet,&rdquo; he answered, grinning; &ldquo;but all goes well. I have
      come back from a far country, but I find the pigs are still grunting. What
      have you done to our old cook?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; was the joyous reply. &ldquo;He tried to swim in his own soup
      and he was drowned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Pierre reported to the officer of the day, that busy functionary
      consulted the record.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a day ahead of your time, Pierre Duval,&rdquo; he said, frowning
      slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the soldier. &ldquo;It costs less to be a day ahead than a
      day too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said the officer, smiling in his red beard. &ldquo;You will
      report to-morrow to your regiment at the citadel. You have a new colonel,
      but the regiment is busy in the old way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Pierre saluted and turned to go out his eye caught the look of a
      general officer who stood near, watching. He was a square, alert, vigorous
      man, his face bronzed by the suns of many African campaigns, his eyes full
      of intelligence, humor, and courage. It was Guillaumat, the new commander
      of the Army of Verdun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are prompt, my son,&rdquo; said he pleasantly, &ldquo;but you must remember not
      to be in a hurry. You have been in hospital. Are you well again? Nothing
      broken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something was broken, my General,&rdquo; responded the soldier gravely, &ldquo;but it
      is mended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the general. &ldquo;Now for the front, to beat the Germans at their
      own game. We shall get them. It may be long, but we shall get them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the autumn of the offensive of 1916, by which the French retook,
      in ten days, what it had cost the Germans many months to gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre was there in that glorious charge at the end of October which
      carried the heights of Douaumont and took six thousand prisoners. He was
      there at the recapture of the Fort de Vaux which the Germans evacuated in
      the first week of November. In the last rush up the slope, where he had
      fought long ago, a stray shell, an inscrutable messenger of fate, coming
      from far away, no one knows whence, caught him and ripped him horribly
      across the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a desperate mass of wounds. But the men of his squad loved their
      corporal. He still breathed. They saw to it that he was carried back to
      the little transit hospital just behind the Fort de Souville.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a rude hut of logs, covered with sand-bags, on the slope of the
      hill. The ruined woods around it were still falling to the crash of
      far-thrown shells. In the close, dim shelter of the inner room Pierre came
      to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up into the face of Father Courcy. A light of recognition and
      gratitude flickered in his eyes. It was like finding an old friend in the
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome!&mdash;But the fort?&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is ours,&rdquo; said the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like a smile passed over the face of Pierre. He could not speak
      for a long time. The blood in his throat choked him. At last he whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Josephine&mdash;love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Courcy bowed his head and took Pierre's hand. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;But now, my dear son Pierre, I must prepare you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The struggling voice from the cot broke in, whispering slowly, with long
      intervals: &ldquo;Not necessary.... I know already.... The penance. ...
      France.... Jeanned'Arc.... It is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few drops of blood gushed from the corner of his mouth. The look of
      peace that often comes to those who die of gunshot wounds settled on his
      face. His eyes grew still as the priest laid the sacred wafer on his lips.
      The broken soldier was made whole.

    <h2>
      THE HEARING EAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      There were three American boys from the region of Philadelphia in the
      dugout, &ldquo;Somewhere in France&rdquo;; and they found it a snug habitation,
      considering the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The central heating system&mdash;a round sheet-iron stove, little larger
      than a &ldquo;topper&rdquo; hat&mdash;sent out incredible quantities of acrid smoke at
      such times as the rusty stovepipe refused to draw. But on cold nights and
      frosty mornings the refractory thing was a distinct consolation. The
      ceiling of the apartment lacked finish. When wet it dropped mud; when dry,
      dust. But it had the merit of being twenty feet thick&mdash;enough to stop
      any German shell except a &ldquo;Jack Johnson&rdquo; full of high explosive. The beds
      were elegantly excavated in the wall, and by a slight forward inclination
      of the body you could use them as <i>fauteuils</i>. The rats approved of
      them highly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two flights of ladder-stairs leading down from the trench into
      the dugout, and the holes at the top which served as vestibules were three
      or four yards apart. It was a comfort to think of this architectural
      design; for if the explosion of a big shell blocked up one of the
      entrances, the other would probably remain open, and you would not be
      caught in a trap with the other rats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main ornament of the <i>salon</i> was a neat but not gaudy
      biscuit-box. The top of it was a centre-table, illuminated by a single,
      guttering candle; the interior was a &ldquo;combination&rdquo; wardrobe and sideboard.
      Around this simple but satisfying piece of furniture the three transient
      tenants of the dugout had just played a game of dummy bridge, and now sat
      smoking and bickering as peacefully as if they were in a college club-room
      in America. The night on the front was what the French call <i>&ldquo;relativement
      calme.&rdquo;</i> Sporadic explosions above punctuated but did not interrupt the
      debate, which eddied about the high theme of Education&mdash;with a
      capital &ldquo;E&rdquo;&mdash;and the particular point of dispute was the study of
      languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is going to change after the war,&rdquo; said Phipps-Herrick, a big
      Harvard man from Bryn Mawr and a member of the Unsocial Socialists' Club.
      &ldquo;We are going to make a new world. Must have a new education. Sweep away
      all the old stuff&mdash;languages, grammar, literature, philosophy,
      history, and all that. Put in something modern and practical. Montessori
      system for the little kids. Vocational training for the bigger ones. Teach
      them to make a living. Then organize them politically and economically.
      You can do what you like, then, with England, France, and America
      together. Germany will be shut out. Why study German? From a practical
      point of view, I ask you, why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you take it at Harvard?&rdquo; sarcastically drawled Rosenlaube, a
      Princeton man from Rittenhouse Square. (His grandfather was born at
      Frankfort-on-the-Main, but his mother was a Biddle, and he had penetrated
      about an inch into the American diplomatic service when the war summoned
      him to a more serious duty.) &ldquo;I understood that all you Harvard men were
      strong on modern languages, especially German.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phipps-Herrick grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I took it. It was supposed to be a soft-snap course. What do
      you think we go to Harvard for? But that little beast, Professor von Buch,
      gave me a cold forty-minus on examination. So I dropped it, and thank God
      I've forgotten the little I ever knew of German! It will be absolutely
      useless in the new world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said Rosenlaube. &ldquo;My grandfather used to speak it when he
      was angry&mdash;a sloppy, slushy language, extremely ugly. At Princeton,
      you know, we stand by the classics, Latin and Greek, the real thing in
      languages. You ought to hear Dean Andy West talk about that. Of course a
      fellow forgets his Virgil and his Homer when he gets out in the world.
      But, then, he's had the benefit of them; they've given him real culture
      and literature. There's nothing outside of the classics, except perhaps a
      few things in French and Italian. Thank God I never studied German!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The third man, who had kept silence up to this point, now gently butted
      in. It was little Phil Mitchell, of Overbrook, a University of
      Pennsylvania man, who had been stopped in his junior year by a financial
      catastrophe in the family, and had gone out to Idaho to earn his living as
      third assistant bookkeeper in a big mining concern. He took a few real
      books with him, besides those that he was to &ldquo;keep.&rdquo; Double entry was his
      business; reading, his recreation; thinking, his vocation. From all this
      the great war called him as with a trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, you fellows,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;in spite of this war and all
      the rest of it, there are some good things in German.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;you, a fire-eater, stand up for the Kaiser and his
      language? Damn him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; assented Mitchell. &ldquo;But the language isn't his. It
      existed a long while before he was born. It isn't very pretty, I'll admit.
      But there are lots of fine things in it. Kant and Lessing, Goethe and
      Schiller and Heine&mdash;they all loved liberty and made it shine out in
      their work. Do you mean to say that I must give them up and throw my
      German overboard because these modern Potsdammers have acted like brutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Phipps-Herrick and Rosenlaube, nodding at each other, &ldquo;that's
      what we mean, and that's what America means. The German language must go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Phipps-Herrick, &ldquo;you admit that modern education must be
      useful? Well, there won't be any more use for German, because we are going
      to shut Germany out of the international trades-union. She has betrayed
      the principles of the new era. We are going to boycott her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't that be rather difficult?&rdquo; queried Mitchell, shaking his head.
      &ldquo;Seventy or eighty million people&mdash;hard to shut them out of the
      world, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, dear Phil,&rdquo; drawled Rosenlaube; &ldquo;it will be easy enough. But I
      don't agree with Phipps-Herrick about the reason or method. We are going
      to have a new era after the war. But it will not be a utilitarian age. It
      will be a return to beauty and form and culture&mdash;not with a 'k.'
      First of all, we are going to kill a great many Germans. Then we are going
      to Berlin to knock down all the ugly statues in the <i>Sieges-Allee</i>
      and smash the parvenu German Empire. Then we shall have a new age on
      classic lines. People will still use French and English and Italian
      because there is some beauty in those languages. But nobody outside of
      Germany will speak or read German. It is a barbarous tongue&mdash;shapeless
      and hideous&mdash;used by barbarians who gobble and snort when they talk.
      Sorry for Kant and Goethe and Heine and all that crowd, but their time is
      up; they've got to go out with their beastly language!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Phipps-Herrick, &ldquo;out with them, bag and baggage. Think what
      the German spies and propagandists have done in America. Schools full of
      pacifist and pro-German teachers; text-books full of praise of the German
      Empire and the Hohenzollern Highbinders; newspapers full of treason,
      printed in the German language. Why, it's only a piece of self-defense to
      clean it all out, root and branch. No more German taught or spoken,
      printed or read, in the United States. Forget it! Twenty-three for the Hun
      language!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble,&rdquo; gently murmured Mitchell, shaking his head again; &ldquo;very noble!
      But not very easy and perhaps not entirely wise. Why should I throw away
      something that has been useful to me, and may be again? Why forget the
      little German that I know and burn my Goethe and refuse to listen to
      Beethoven's music? I won't do it, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our little friend is a concealed Kaiserite,&rdquo; said Rosenlaube. &ldquo;He wants
      to Germanize America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Rosy,&rdquo; said Mitchell, thoughtfully running his hand over some nicks
      on the butt of his rifle in the corner; &ldquo;you know I'm not a Kaiserite of
      any kind. I've got seven scored against him already, and I'm going to get
      some more. But the language question seems to me different. Cut out the
      German newspapers and the German schools in America by all means! No more
      teaching of the primary branches in any language but English! Make it
      absolutely necessary for everybody in the U. S. A. to learn the language
      of the country the first thing. Then in the high schools and universities
      let German be studied like any other foreign language, by those who want
      it&mdash;chemists, and philosophers, and historians, and electrical
      engineers, and so on. We could censor the text-books and keep out all
      complimentary allusions to the Hohenzollern family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut up, Phil,&rdquo; growled Phipps-Herrick. &ldquo;You're too soft, you old
      easy-mark! You don't go half far enough. We may not decide to exterminate
      the Hun race in Europe. But we have decided to exterminate their language
      in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand was groping inside the biscuit-box. He pulled out a little
      ditty-bag and carefully extracted a bit of newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to this, you fellows. This is from the National Obscurity Society.
      You know a chap with a German name is president of it, but he's a real
      patriot, hundred per cent, not fifty-fifty, Philly. 'The following States
      have abolished the teaching of German: Massachusetts, Connecticut, New
      York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, Mississippi,
      Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Arkansas,
      Arizona, Colorado, Montana, California, and Oregon.' <i>Abolished</i>,
      mind you! What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most excellent Phippick,&rdquo; nodded Rosenlaube, &ldquo;I opine, as Horace said to
      Cicero, 'That's the stuff,' or words to that effect. What saith the
      senator from Mitchellville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble,&rdquo; grinned Phil, &ldquo;unmistakably noble! Those Obscurity fellows are a
      fiery lot. It reminds me that during the late war with Spain, when I was a
      little, tiny boy, but brimful of ferocity, I refused to eat my favorite
      dessert because it was called <i>Spanish</i> cream. I felt sure at the
      time that my heroic conduct was of distinct assistance to Dewey in the
      battle of Manila Bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Phipps-Herrick, grabbing him by the shoulders and
      shaking him good-humoredly, &ldquo;you murderous little pacifist with seven
      nicks on your gun, will you give up your German? Will you forget it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mitchell chuckled and shook his head,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as requisite under military orders. But no further, not by a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pair of muddy boots was heard and seen descending one of the ladders,
      followed by the manly and still rather neat form of Lieutenant Barker
      Bunn, a Cornell man from West Philadelphia. The three men sprang to their
      feet and saluted smartly, for the lieutenant was very stiff about all the
      preliminary forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too loud talking here,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;I heard you before I came down.
      Who is here? Oh, I see, Sergeant Phipps-Herrick, Privates Rosenlaube and
      Mitchell. It's your turn to go out on listening post to-night, sergeant.
      Twelve sharp, stay three hours, go as far as you can, come back and
      report, take Mitchell or Rosenlaube with you. Captain's orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant saluted again, and the two men looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not both of us, sir?&rdquo; said Mitchell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant regarded him with some surprise. Listening post is not a
      detail passionately desired by the men. It is always dirty, frequently
      dangerous, generally obscure, and often fatal. Hence there is no keen
      competition for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two is the usual number for a listening post,&rdquo; said Barker Bunn
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;But there is no regulation about it, and the captain did
      not specify any number. Well, yes, I suppose you can all three go, if you
      are set on it. In fact, I give the order to that effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Rosenlaube and Mitchell. Phipps-Herrick, feeling
      that the strict etiquette of the preliminaries had been fully observed and
      the time to be human had come, held out a box of &ldquo;Fierce Fairies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a cigarette, Bunn, and take a chair, do. Time for a little talk this
      quiet night? Tell us what's doing up above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing particular,&rdquo; said Barker Bunn, lighting and relaxing. &ldquo;But the
      old man has a hunch that the Fritzies are grubbing a mine&mdash;a corker&mdash;to
      get our goat. Hence this business of ears forward. The old man thinks the
      Fritzies have a strong grouch against this little alley, and since they
      couldn't take it top side last week they're going to try to bust it out
      bottom side with a big bang some day soon. Maybe so&mdash;maybe just
      greens&mdash;but, anyway, you've got to go on the Q. T. with this job&mdash;no
      noise, don't even whisper unless you have to; just listen for all you're
      worth. P'r'aps you'll hear that little tap-tap-tapping that tells where
      Fritzie Mole is at work. Then if you come back and tell the old man where
      it is, he'll give you all the cigarettes you want. But say, do you want me
      to give you a pointer on the way to go, the method of procedure, as the
      old man would call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They agreed that they were thirsting for information and instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's this way,&rdquo; continued Barker Bunn. &ldquo;You know I had a bit of
      experience in listening post while I was with the Canadians down around
      'Wipers'; and I noticed that most of the troubles came from a bad method
      of procedure. Fellows went out any old way; followed each other in the
      dark, and then hunted for each other and came to grief; all those kind of
      silly fumbles. Now, what you need is <i>formation</i>&mdash;see? Must have
      some sort of formation for advance. Must keep in touch. For two men a
      tandem is right. For three men, what you want is a spike-team&mdash;middle
      man crawls ahead, other men follow on each side just near enough to touch
      his left heel with right hand and right heel with left hand&mdash;a
      triangle, see? Keep touching once every thirty seconds. If you miss it,
      leader crawls back, side men crawl in, sure to meet, nobody gets lost. Go
      as far <i>as</i> you can, then spread out like a fan, fold together <i>when</i>
      you can, come back <i>if</i> you can&mdash;that's the way to cover the
      most possible ground on a listening post. Do you get me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We get you,&rdquo; they nodded. &ldquo;It's a wonderful scheme.&rdquo; And Rosenlaube added
      in his most impressive literary manner: &ldquo;Plato, it <i>must</i> be so, thou
      reasonest well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, &ldquo;what were you fellows chattering
      about so loud when I came down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they told him, and, according to the habit of college boys, they
      skirmished over the ground of debate again, and Barker Bunn vigorously
      supported the majority opinion, and Mitchell was left in a hopeless
      minority of one, clinging obstinately to his faith that there had been,
      and still might be, some use for the German language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midnight came, and with it the return of the lieutenant's official manner.
      He saw the trio slide over the top, one by one, vanishing in the starless
      dark. &ldquo;Good luck going and coming,&rdquo; he whispered; and it sounded almost
      like an unofficial prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In single file they crept through the prepared opening in the barbed-wire
      entanglement, and so out into No Man's Land, where they took up their
      spike-team formation. Phipps-Herrick was the leader, the other men were
      the wheelers. They had agreed on a code of silent signals: One kick with
      the heel or one pinch with the hand meant &ldquo;stop&rdquo;; two meant &ldquo;back&rdquo;; three
      meant &ldquo;get together.&rdquo; They carried no rifles, because the rifle is an
      awkward tool for a noiseless crawler to lug. But each man had a big
      trench-knife and a pair of automatic pistols, with plenty of ammunition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The space between the two front lines of barbed wire in this region was
      not more than four or five hundred yards. In the murk of that unstarred,
      drizzling night, where every inch must be felt out, it seemed like a vast,
      horrible territory. There was nothing monotonous about it but the
      blackness of darkness. To the touch it was a <i>paysage accidente</i>, a
      landscape full of surprises. Dead bodies were sprinkled over it. It was
      pockmarked with small shell-holes and pitted with large craters, many of
      them full of water, all slimy with mud. Phipps-Herrick nearly slipped into
      one of the deepest, but a lively kick warned his followers of the danger,
      and they pulled him back by the heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then a star-shell looped across the spongy sky, casting a lurid
      illumination over the ghastly field. When the three travellers caught the
      soft swish of its ascent, they &ldquo;froze&rdquo;&mdash;motionless as a shamming
      'possum&mdash;mimicking death among the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long, slow, silent, revolting crawl. Sounds which did not concern
      them were plenty&mdash;distant cannonade, shells exploding here and there,
      scattered rifle-shots. All these they unconsciously eliminated, listening
      for something else, ears pressed to the ground wherever they could find a
      comparatively dry spot. From their point of hearing the night was still as
      the grave&mdash;no subterranean tapping and scraping could they hear
      anywhere under the sea of mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Rosenlaube caught a faint metallic sound, and signalled through
      Phipps-Herrick's left leg to Mitchell's left arm, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; All three
      listened tensely. They crawled toward the faint noise. It was made by a
      loose end of wire swaying in the night-wind and tapping on a broken
      helmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were getting close to the German barbed wire. The leader had swung
      around to the west, following what he judged to be the line of the front
      trench, perhaps forty yards away. He was determined to hear something
      before he went back. And he did!
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he had made up his mind to call up the other fellows for the final
      spreadout in fan formation, his groping right hand touched something round
      and smooth and hard. It seemed to be made fast to a string or wire, but he
      pulled it toward him and gave the &ldquo;stop&rdquo; signal to his followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing he had picked up was a telephone receiver. How it came to be
      there he did not know. Perhaps a German listening post had carried it out
      last night, in order to receive directions from the trench; perhaps the
      mining party&mdash;man killed, receiver dropped, wire connection not cut,
      or tangled up with other wires&mdash;who can tell? One thing is sure&mdash;here
      is the receiver, faintly buzzing. Phipps-Herrick joyfully puts it to his
      ear. He hears a voice and words, but it is all gibberish to him. With a
      look of desperation on his face he gives the &ldquo;get together&rdquo; signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosenlaube crawls up first and takes hold of the cylinder, puts it to his
      ear. He hears the sound, but it says absolutely nothing to him. It is like
      being at the door of the secret of the universe and unable to get over the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes Mitchell, slowly, a little lame, and almost &ldquo;all in.&rdquo;
       Phipps-Herrick thrusts the receiver into his hand. As he listens a
      beatific expression spreads over his face. It lasts a long time, and then
      he lays down the cylinder with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three heads are close together, and Mitchell whispers under his
      breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got 'em&mdash;got the whole thing&mdash;line of mine changed&mdash;raiders
      coming out now&mdash;twelve men&mdash;rough on us, but if we can get back
      to our alley we've got 'em! Crawl home quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration with caption: &ldquo;I'm going to carry you in, spite of hell"}
    </p>
    <p>
      They crawled together in a bunch, formation ignored. Presently steps
      sounded near them. A swift light swept the hole where they crouched, a
      volley of rifle-shots crashed into it. The Americans answered with their
      pistols, and saw three or four of the dark forms on the edge of the hole
      topple over. The rest disappeared. But Rosenlaube had a rifle-ball through
      his right hip and another through his shoulder. Mitchell and
      Phipps-Herrick started to carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop it,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I'm safe here till dawn&mdash;you get home,
      quick! Specially Phil. He's the one that counts. Cut away, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the American trench had opened fire and the German trench
      answered. The still night broke into a tempest of noise. A bullet or a bit
      of shell caught Mitchell in the knee and crumpled him up. Phipps-Herrick
      lifted him on his back and stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you little cuss. You're the only one that has the
      stuff we went out after. I'm going to carry you in, 'spite of hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mitchell told the full story of the change in the direction of the German
      mine and the plan of the next assault, as he had heard it through that
      lost receiver. The captain said it was information of the highest value.
      It counted up to a couple of hundred German prisoners and three
      machine-guns in the next two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosenlaube, still alive, was brought in just before daybreak by a
      volunteer rescue-party under the guidance of Phipps-Herrick. All three
      were cited in the despatches. Phipps-Herrick in due time received the
      Distinguished Service Cross for gallantry on the field. But Mitchell had
      the surplus satisfaction of the hearing ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, old man,&rdquo; Rosenlaube said to him as they lay side by side in
      the hospital, &ldquo;'member our talk in the dugout just before our big night?
      Well, I allow there was something in what you said. There are times when
      it is a good thing to know a bit of that barbarous German language. And
      you never can tell when one of those times may hit you.&rdquo;

      SKETCHES OF QUEBEC
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you love a certain country, for its natural beauty, or for the friends
      you have made there, or for the happy days you have passed within its
      borders, you are troubled and distressed when that country comes under
      criticism, suspicion, and reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is just as it would be if a woman who had been very kind to you and had
      done you a great deal of good were accused of some unworthiness. You would
      refuse to believe it. You would insist on understanding before you
      pronounced judgment. Memories would ask to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is what I feel in regard to French Canada, the province of Quebec,
      where I have had so many joyful times, and found so many true comrades
      among the <i>voyageurs</i>, the <i>habitants</i>, and the <i>coureurs de
      bois.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      People are saying now that Quebec is not loyal, not brave, not patriotic
      in this war for freedom and humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if the accusation were true, of course it would not spoil the big
      woods, the rushing rivers, the sparkling lakes, the friendly mountains of
      French Canada. But all the same, it hurts me to hear such a charge against
      my friends of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you mean to tell me that Francois and Ferdinand and Louis and Jean and
      Eugene and Iside are not true men? Do you mean to tell me that these
      lumbermen who steer big logs down steep places, these trappers who brave
      the death-cold grip of Winter, these canoe-men who shout for joy as they
      run the foaming rapids,&mdash;do you mean to tell me that they have no
      courage?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not ready to credit that. I want to hear what they have to say for
      themselves. And in listening for that testimony certain little
      remembrances come to me&mdash;not an argument&mdash;only a few sketches on
      the wall. Here they are. Take them for what they are worth.

      LA GRANDE DECHARGE
    </h3>
    <p>
      September, 1894
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the long stillwaters of the mighty stream that rushes from <i>Lac
      Saint Jean</i> to make the Saguenay&mdash;below the <i>Ile Maligne</i> and
      above the cataract of Chicoutimi&mdash;two birch-bark canoes are floating
      quietly, descending with rhythmic strokes of the paddle, through the
      luminous northern twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief guide, Jean Morel, is a <i>coureur de bois</i> of the old type&mdash;broad-shouldered,
      red-bearded, a fearless canoeman, a good hunter and fisherman&mdash;simple
      of speech and deep of heart: a good man to trust in the rapids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Jean,&rdquo; I ask in the comfortable leisure of our voyage which
      conduces to pipe-smoking and conversation, &ldquo;tell me, are you a Frenchman
      or an Englishman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the one, nor the other,&rdquo; answers Jean in his old-fashioned <i>patois.</i>
      &ldquo;M'sieu' knows I am French-Canadian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A remarkable answer, when you come to think of it; for it claims a
      nationality which has never existed, and is not likely to exist, except in
      a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; I say, following my impulse of psychological curiosity, of
      which Jean is sublimely ignorant, &ldquo;suppose a war should come between
      France and England. On which side would you fight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jean knocks the dottle out of his pipe, refills and relights. Then,
      between the even strokes of his paddle, he makes this extraordinary reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;M'sieu, I suppose my body would march under the flag of England. But
      my heart would march under the flag of France.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Good old Jean Morel! You had no premonition of this glorious war in which
      the Tricolor and the Union Jack would advance together against the
      ravening black eagle of Germany, and the Stars and Stripes would join
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      How should you know anything about it? Your log cabin was your capitol.
      Your little family was your council of state. Even the rest of us, proud
      of our university culture, were too blind, in those late Victorian days,
      to see the looming menace of Prussian paganism and the conquer-lust of the
      Hohenzollerns, which has plunged the whole world in war.

      OXFORD
    </h3>
    <p>
      February, 1917
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Schools&rdquo; building, though modern, is one of the stateliest on the
      Main Street. Here, in old peaceful times, the university examinations used
      to be held. Now it is transformed into a hospital for the wounded men from
      the fighting front of freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir William Osier, Canadian, and world-renowned physician, is my guide, an
      old friend in Baltimore, now Regius Professor of Medicine in Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I want you to see an example of the Carrel treatment of
      wounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patient is sitting up in bed&mdash;a fine young fellow about twenty
      years old. A shrapnel-shell, somewhere in France, passed over his head and
      burst just behind him. His bare back is a mass of scars. The healing fluid
      is being pumped in through the shattered elbow of his right arm, not yet
      out of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it hurt,&rdquo; I ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; he answers, trying to smile, &ldquo;at least not too much, M'sieu'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accent of French Canada is unmistakable. I talk to him in his own
      dialect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What part of Quebec do you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From <i>Trois Rivieres,</i> M'sieu', or rather from a country back of
      that, the Saint Maurice River.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it well&mdash;often hunted there. But what made you go to the
      war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard that England fought to save France from the damned Germans. That
      was enough, M'sieu', to make me march. Besides, I always liked to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do before you became a soldier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a lumberjack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (What he really said was, <i>&ldquo;J'allais en chantier,&rdquo;</i> &ldquo;I went in the
      shanty.&rdquo; If he had spoken in classic French he would have said, <i>&ldquo;J'etais
      bucheron.&rdquo;</i> How it brought back the smell of the big spruce forest to
      hear that word <i>chantier</i>, in Oxford!)
    </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: &ldquo;I was a lumberjack."}
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I suppose you will return to the wood-cutting again, when
      this war is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no, M'sieu', how can I, with this good-for-nothing arm? I shall never
      be capable of swinging the axe again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you could be the cook, perfectly. And you know the cook gets the best
      pay in the whole shanty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face lights up a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; he replies; &ldquo;I never thought of that, but it is true. I have seen
      a bit of cooking at the front and learned some things. I might take up
      that end of the job. <i>But anyway, Im glad I went to the war.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      So we say good-by&mdash;<i>&ldquo;bonne chance!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that day the good physician who guided me through the hospital has
      borne without a murmur the greatest of all sacrifices&mdash;the loss of
      his only son, a brave and lovely boy, killed in action against the
      thievish, brutal German hordes.

    <h3>

    <p>
      SAINTE MARGUERITE August, 1917
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild little river <i>Sainte Marguerite</i> runs joyously among the
      mountains and the green woods, back of the Saguenay, singing the same old
      song of liberty and obedience to law, as if the world had never been vexed
      and tortured by the madness of war-lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tired man who has a brief furlough from active service is lucky if he
      can spend it among the big trees and beside a flowing stream. The trees
      are ministers of peace. The stream is full of courage and adventure as it
      rushes toward the big sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are coming back to camp from the morning's fishing, with a brace of
      good salmon in the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Iside,&rdquo; I ask of the wiry little bowman, the best hunter and
      fisher on the river, &ldquo;why is it that you are not at the war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, M'sieu', I am too old. A father of family&mdash;almost a grandfather&mdash;the
      war is not for men of that age. Besides, it does not concern us here in
      Quebec.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It concerns the whole world. Who told you that it does not
      concern you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priest at our village of <i>Sacre Coeur,</i> M'sieu'. He says that it
      is only right and needful for a good Christian to fight in defense of his
      home and his church. Let those Germans attack us here, <i>chez nous</i>,
      and you shall see how the men of <i>Sacre Coeur</i> will stand up and
      fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an amazing revelation of a state of mind, absolutely simple,
      perfectly sincere, and strictly imprisoned by the limitations of its only
      recognized teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose, Iside, that England and France should be beaten down by
      Germany, over there. What would happen to French Canada? Do you think you
      could stand alone then, to defend your home and your church? Are you big
      enough, you French-Canadians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M'sieu', I have never thought of that. Perhaps we have more than a
      million people&mdash;many of them children, for you understand we
      French-Canadians have large families&mdash;but of course the children
      could not fight. Still, we should not like to have them subject to a
      German Emperor. We would fight against that, if the war came to us here on
      our own soil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you see that the only way to keep it from coming to you on your
      own soil is to fight against it over there? Hasn't the English Government
      given you all your liberties, for home and church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, M'sieu', especially since Sir Wilfred Laurier. Ah, that is a great
      man! A true French-Canadian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you know that he is against Germany. You know he believes the
      freedom of Canada depends on the defeat of Germany, over there, on the
      other side of the sea. You would not like a German Canada, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, M'sieu', that would be intolerable. But I have never thought
      of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, think of it now, will you? And tell your priest to think of it,
      too. He is a Christian. The things we are fighting for belong to
      Christianity&mdash;justice, liberty, humanity. Tell him that, and tell him
      also some of the things which the Germans did to the Christian people in
      Belgium and Northern France. I will narrate them to you later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M'sieu',&rdquo; says Iside, dipping his paddle deeper as we round the sharp
      corner of a rock, &ldquo;I shall remember all that you tell me, and I shall tell
      it again to our priest. You know we have few newspapers here. Most of us
      could not read them, anyway. I am not well convinced that we yet
      comprehend, here in French Canada, the meaning of this war. But we shall
      endeavor to comprehend it better. And when we comprehend, we shall be
      ready to do our duty&mdash;you can trust yourself to the men of <i>Sacre
      Coeur</i> for that. We love peace&mdash;we all about here <i>(nous autres
      d'icite)&mdash;but we can fight like the devil when we know it is for a
      good cause&mdash;liberty, for example.</i> Meanwhile would M'sieu' like to
      stop at the pool <i>'La Pinette''</i> on the way down and try a couple of
      casts? There was a big salmon rising there yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That very evening a runner comes up the river, through the woods, to tell
      Iside and Eugene, who are Selectmen of the community of <i>Sacre Coeur,</i>
      that they must come down to the village for an important meeting at ten
      o'clock the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they set off, quite as a matter of course, for their thirty-five mile
      tramp through the forest in the dark. They are good citizens, as well as
      good woodsmen, you understand. On the second day they are back again at
      their work in the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Iside,&rdquo; I ask, &ldquo;how was it with the meeting yesterday? All
      correct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All correct, M'sieu'. It was an affair of a new schoolhouse. We are going
      to build it. All goes well. We are beginning to comprehend. Quebec is a
      large corner of the world. But it is only a corner, after all, we can see
      that. And those damned Germans who do such terrible things in France, we
      do not love them at all, no matter what the priest may say about Christian
      charity. They are Protestants, M'sieu', is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answer, hiding a smile with a large puff of smoke, &ldquo;some of them
      call themselves Protestants and some call themselves Catholics. But it
      seems to me they are all infidels, heathen&mdash;judging by what they do.
      That is the real proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;C'est b'en vrai, M'sieu',</i>&rdquo; says Iside. &ldquo;It is the conduct that
      shows the Christian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      BELOW CAPE DIAMOND March, 1818
    </p>
    <p>
      The famous citadel of Quebec stands on top of the steep hill that
      dominates the junction of the Saint Charles River with the Saint Lawrence.
      That is Cape Diamond&mdash;a natural stronghold. Indians and French, and
      British, and Americans have fought for that coign of vantage. For a
      century and a half the Union Jack has floated there, and under its fair
      protection the Province of Quebec, keeping its quaint old language and
      peasant customs, has become an important part of the British Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Upper Town, on the high shoulders of Cape Diamond, with its government
      buildings, convents, hospitals, showy new shops, and ancient gardens, its
      archiepiscopal palace, trim theological seminary, huge castle-like hotel,
      and placid ramparts dominating the <i>Ile d'Orleans</i> with rows of
      antiquated, harmless cannon around which the children play&mdash;the Upper
      Town belongs distinctly to the citadel. The garrison is in evidence here.
      A regimental band plays in the kiosk on Dufferin Terrace on summer
      evenings. There is a good mixture of khaki in the coloring of the street
      crowd, and many wounded soldiers are seen, invalided home from the front.
      They are all very proud of the glorious record that Canada has made in the
      battle for freedom. Most of them, it seems to me, are from
      English-speaking families. But by no means all. There are many of
      unmistakable French-Canadian stock; and they tell me proudly of the
      notable bravery of a certain regiment which was formed early from
      volunteers of their own people&mdash;hunters, woodsmen, farmers, guides.
      The war does not seem very far away, up here in the region of the citadel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lower Town, with its narrow streets, little shops, gray stone
      warehouses, dingy tenements, and old-fashioned markets, is quite a
      different place. It belongs to the slow rivers on whose banks it drowses
      and dreams. The once prosperous lumberyards are half empty now. The
      shipping along the wharfs has been dwindling for many years. The northern
      winter puts a quietus on the waterside. Troops, munitions, supplies, must
      go down by rail to an ice-free port. The white river-boats are all laid
      up. But a way is kept open across the river to Levis, and the sturdy,
      snub-nosed little ice-breaking ferry-boats buffet back and forth almost
      without interruption. There is a plenty of nothing to do, now, in the
      Lower Town; pipe-smoking and heated discussion of parish politics are
      incessant; an inconsiderate quantity of bad liquor is imbibed, <i>pour
      faire passer le temps.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly&mdash;if anything can be said to happen suddenly in Quebec&mdash;bad
      news comes from the Lower Town. A riot has broken out, an insurrection of
      the French-Canadians against the new military service act, an armed
      resistance to the draft. Windows have been smashed, shops looted. A mob,
      not very large perhaps, but extremely noisy, has marched up the steep
      curve of Mountain Hill Street, into the Upper Town. Shots have been
      exchanged. People have been killed. The revolution in Quebec has begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the disquieting rumor which comes to us, carefully spread and
      magnified by those agencies which have an interest in preventing, or at
      least obstructing the righteous punishment of the German criminals in this
      war. Can it possibly be true? Have the French-Canadians gone crazy, as the
      Irish did in 1916, under the lunatic incantations of the Sinn-Feiners? Are
      they also people without a country, playing blindly into the hands of the
      Prussian gang who have set out to subjugate the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      No! This riot in the old city is not an expression of the spirit of French
      Canada at all. It is only a shrewdly stupid trick in local politics,
      planned and staged by small-minded and loud-voiced politicians who are
      trying to keep their hold upon the province. The so-called revolutionists
      are either imported loafers and trouble-makers, or else they are drawn
      from that class of &ldquo;hooligans&rdquo; who have always made a noise around the
      Quebec hotels at night. They shout much: they swear abominably: but they
      have no real fight in them. They can be hired and used&mdash;up to a
      certain point&mdash;but beyond that they are worthless. It is a waste of
      money to employ them. The trouble below Cape Diamond froths up and goes
      down as quickly as the effervescence on a bottle of ginger beer. Before
      you can find out what it is all about, it is all over. It has not even
      touched the real French-Canadians, the men of the forests and the farms.
      They are loyal by nature, and slow by temperament. You have got to give
      them time, and light.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is happening in Quebec now? Just what ought to happen. The draft is
      going forward smoothly and steadily, without resistance. Sons of the best
      French-Canadian families are volunteering for the war. Recruits from Laval
      University are coming in, stirred perhaps by the knowledge that forty
      thousand Catholic priests in France have entered the army which fights
      against the Prussian paganism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The petty politicians who have sought to serve their own ends by putting
      forward the mad notion of secession and an independent &ldquo;Republic of
      Quebec&rdquo; have gone to cover under a storm of ridicule and indignation. M.
      Bourassa's iridescent dream of French-Canadian nationalism has disappeared
      like a soap-bubble. M. Francoeur's motion in the Quebec legislature,
      carrying a vague hint that the province might withdraw from the Dominion
      if the other provinces were not particularly nice to it, was snowed under
      by an overwhelming vote. The patriotic and eloquent speech of the
      provincial Premier, M. Gouin, was received with every sign of approval.
      The political cinema has shown its latest film, and the title is evidently
      <i>&ldquo;Fidelite de Quebec.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime a Catholic missioner has been in the province. The visit of
      Archbishop Mathieu of Saskatchewan was probably made on the invitation,
      certainly with the consent, of the hierarchy of Quebec. That intelligent
      and fearless preacher brought with him a clear and ringing gospel, a call
      to all Christian folk to stand up together and &ldquo;resist even unto blood,
      striving against sin&rdquo;&mdash;the sin of the German war-lords who have
      plunged the world in agony to enforce their heresy that Might makes Right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a message, at this time, must be of inestimable value to the humble
      and devout people of the province, attached as they are to their church,
      and looking patiently to her for guidance. The parish priests, devoted to
      their lonely tasks in obscure hamlets, may get a new and broader
      inspiration from it. They may have a vision of the ashes of Louvain
      University, the ruin of Rheims Cathedral, wrought by ruthless German
      hands. Then the church in Quebec will measure up to the church in Belgium
      and in France. Then the village cure will say to his young men: &ldquo;Go!
      Fight! It is for the glory of God and the good of the world. It is for the
      Christian religion and the life of free Canada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says the gentle reader, of a sociological turn of mind, who
      has followed me thus far, &ldquo;what have you got to say about the big
      political problem of Quebec? Is a French-speaking province a safe factor
      in the Dominion of Canada, in the British Empire? Why was Quebec so late
      in coming into this world war against Germany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dear man, I have nothing whatever to say about what you call the big
      political problem of Quebec. I told you that at the beginning. That is a
      question for Canada and Great Britain to settle. The British colonial
      policy has always been one of the greatest liberality and fairness, except
      perhaps in that last quarter of the eighteenth century, when the madness
      of a German king and his ministers in England forced the United States to
      break away from her, and form the republic which has now become her most
      powerful friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perpetuation of a double language within a state, an <i>enclave</i>,
      undoubtedly carries with it an element of inconvenience and possibly of
      danger. Yet Belgium is bilingual and Switzerland is quadrilingual. If any
      tongue other than that of the central government is to be admitted, what
      could be better than French&mdash;the language of culture, which has
      spoken the large words, <i>liberte, egalite, fraternite?</i> The native
      dialect of French Canada is a quaint and delightful thing&mdash;an
      eighteenth-century vocabulary with pepper and salt from the speech of the
      woodsmen and hunters. I should be sorry if it had to fade out. But
      evidently that is a question for Canada to decide. She has been a
      bilingual country for a long time. I see no reason why the experiment
      should not be carried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quebec has been rather slow in waking up to the meaning of this war for
      world-freedom. But she has been very little slower than some of the United
      States, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Church? Well, the influence of the Church always has depended and
      always must depend upon the quality of her ministers. In France, in
      Belgium, they have not fallen short of their high duty. The Archbishop of
      Saskatchewan, who came to Quebec, preached a clear gospel of
      self-sacrifice for a righteous cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the plain people of Quebec&mdash;the <i>voyageurs</i>, the <i>habitants</i>,
      my old friends in the back districts&mdash;that is what I am thinking
      about. I am sure they are all right. They are very simple, old-fashioned,
      childish, if you like; but there is no pacifist or pro-German virus among
      them. If their parochial politicians will let them alone, if their priests
      will speak to them as prophets of the God of Righteousness, they will show
      their mettle. They will prove their right to be counted among the free
      peoples of the world who are willing to defend peace with arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is what I expect to find if I ever get back to my canoemen on the <i>Sainte
      Marguerite</i> again.

    <h2>
      A CLASSIC INSTANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Latin and Greek are dead,&rdquo; said Hardman, lean, eager, absolute, a fanatic
      of modernity. &ldquo;They have been a long while dying, and this war has
      finished them. We see now that they are useless in the modern world.
      Nobody is going to waste time in studying them. Education must be direct
      and scientific. Train men for efficiency and prepare them for defense.
      Otherwise they will have no chance of making a living or of keeping what
      they make. Your classics are musty and rusty and fusty. <i>Heraus mit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He checked himself suddenly, with as near a blush as his sallow skin could
      show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;bad habit, contracted when I was a student at
      Kiel&mdash;only place where they really understood metallurgy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Professor John De Vries, round, rosy, white-haired, steeped in the mellow
      lore of ancient history, puffed his cigar and smiled that benignant smile
      with which he was accustomed joyfully to enter a duel of wits. Many such
      conflicts had enlivened that low-ceilinged book-room of his at Calvinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are excused, my dear Hardman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;especially because you have
      just given us a valuable illustration of the truth that language and the
      study of language have a profound influence upon thought. The tongue which
      you inadvertently used belongs to the country that bred the theory of
      education which you advocate. The theory is as crude and imperfect as the
      German language itself. And that is saying a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Richard De Vries, the professor's favorite nephew and adopted son,
      whose chief interest was athletics, but who had a very pretty side taste
      for verbal bouts, was sitting with the older men before a cheerful fire of
      logs in the chilly spring of 1917. He tucked one leg comfortably
      underneath him and leaned forward in his chair, lighting a fresh
      cigarette. He foresaw a brisk encounter, and was delighted, as one who
      watches from the side-lines the opening of a lively game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well played, sir,&rdquo; he ejaculated; &ldquo;well played, indeed. Score one for
      you, Uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The approbation of the young is the consolation of the aged,&rdquo; murmured
      the professor sententiously, as if it were a quotation from Plutarch. &ldquo;But
      let us hear what our friend Hardman has to say about the German language
      and the Germanic theory of education. It is his turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I throw you in the German language,&rdquo; answered Hardman, rather tartly. &ldquo;I
      don't profess to admire it or defend it. But nobody can deny its utility
      for the things that are taught in it. You can learn more science from half
      a dozen recent German books than from a whole library of Latin and Greek.
      Besides, you must admit that the Germans are great classical scholars
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather neat,&rdquo; commented Dick; &ldquo;you touched him there, Mr. Hardman. Now,
      Uncle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not admit,&rdquo; said the professor firmly, &ldquo;that the Germans are great
      classical scholars. They are great students, that is all. The difference
      is immense. Far be it from me to deny the value of the patient and
      laborious researches of the Germans in the grammar and syntax of the
      ancient languages and in archaeology. They are painstaking to a painful
      degree. They gather facts as bees gather pollen, indefatigably. But when
      it comes to making honey they go dry. They cannot interpret, they can only
      instruct. They do not comprehend, they only classify. Name me one recent
      German book of classical interpretation to compare in sweetness and light
      with Jowett's 'Dialogues of Plato' or Butcher's 'Some Aspects of the Greek
      Genius' or Croiset's 'Histoire de la Litterature Grecque.' You can't do
      it,&rdquo; he ended, with a note of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; replied Hardman sharply. &ldquo;I never claimed to know
      anything about classical literature or scholarship. My point at the
      beginning&mdash;you have cleverly led the discussion away from it, like
      one of your old sophists&mdash;the point I made was that Greek and Latin
      are dead languages, and therefore practically worthless in the modern
      world. Let us go back to that and discuss it fairly and leave the Germans
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that, my dear fellow, is precisely what you cannot do. It is partly
      because they have insisted on treating Latin and Greek as dead that the
      Germans have become what they are&mdash;spectacled barbarians, learned
      Huns, veneered Vandals. In older times it was not so bad. They had some
      perception of the everlasting current of life in the classics. When the
      Latin spirit touched them for a while, they acquired a sense of form, they
      produced some literature that was good&mdash;Lessing, Herder, Goethe,
      Schiller. But it was a brief illumination, and the darkness that followed
      it was deeper than ever. Who are their foremost writers to-day? The
      Hauptmanns and the Sudermanns, gropers in obscurity, violent
      sentimentalists, 'bigots to laxness,' Dr. Johnson would have called them.
      Their world is a moral and artistic chaos agitated by spasms of hysteria.
      Their work is a mass of decay touched with gleams of phosphorescence. The
      Romans would have called it <i>immunditia</i>. What is your new American
      word for that kind of thing, Richard? I heard you use it the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Punk,&rdquo; responded Dick promptly. &ldquo;Sometimes, if it's very sickening, we
      call it pink punk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; interrupted Hardman impatiently. &ldquo;Say what you like about
      Hauptmann and Sudermann. They are no friends of mine. Be as ferocious with
      them as you please. But you surely do not mean to claim that the right
      kind of study and understanding of the classics could have had any
      practical influence on the German character, or any value in saving the
      German Empire from its horrible blunders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely that is what I do mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through the mind, <i>animus</i>, the intelligent directing spirit which
      guides human conduct in all who have passed beyond the stage of mere
      barbarism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You exaggerate the part played by what you call the mind. Human conduct
      is mainly a matter of heredity and environment. Most of it is determined
      by instinct, impulse, and habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted, for the sake of argument. But may there not be a mental as well
      as a physical inheritance, an environment of thought as well as of bodily
      circumstances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so. Yes, I suppose that is true to a certain extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poor phrase, my dear Hardman; but let it pass. Will you admit that
      there may be habits of thinking and feeling as well as habits of doing and
      making things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you recognize a difference between bad habits and good habits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you agree that this difference exists both in mental and in physical
      affairs? For example, you would call the foreman of a machine-shop who
      directed his work in accordance with the natural laws of his material and
      of his steam or electric power a man of good habits, would you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would not deny him this name, but would rather emphasize it, if
      in addition he had the habit of paying regard to the moral and social laws
      which condition the welfare and efficiency of his workmen; for example,
      self-control, cheerfulness, honesty, fair play, honor, human kindness, and
      so on. If he taught these things, not only by word but by deed, you would
      call him an excellent foreman, would you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a question. That machine-shop would be a great success, a model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose your foreman had none of these good mental and moral habits.
      Suppose he was proud, overbearing, dishonest, unfair, and cruel. Do you
      not believe he would have a bad influence upon his men? Would not the
      shop, no matter what kind of work it turned out, become a nest of evil and
      a menace to its neighbors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It surely would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, would you do with the foreman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would try to teach him better. If that failed, I would discharge him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what method and by what means would you endeavor to teach him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all the means that I could command. By precept and by example, by
      warning him of his faults and by showing him better ways, by wholesome
      books and good company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he refused to learn; if he remained obstinate; if he mocked you
      and called you a hypocrite; if he claimed that his way was the best, in
      fact the only way, divinely inspired, and therefore beyond all criticism,
      then you would throw him out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, and quickly! I should regard him as morally insane, and try my
      best to put him where he could do no more harm. But tell me why this
      protracted imitation of Socrates? Where are you trying to lead me? Do you
      want me to say that the German Kaiser is a very bad foreman of his shop;
      that he has got it into a horrible mess and made it despised and hated by
      all the other shops; that he ought to be put out? If that is your point, I
      am with you in advance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; cried Dick joyously. &ldquo;Can the Kaiser! We all agree to
      that. And here the bout ends, with honors for both sides, and a special
      prize for the Governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The professor smiled, recognizing in the name more affection than
      disrespect. He leaned forward in his chair, lighting a fresh cigar with
      gusto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;O too enthusiastic youth! Our friend here has not yet
      come to the point at which I was aiming. The application of my remarks to
      the Kaiser&mdash;whom I regard as a gifted paranoiac&mdash;is altogether
      too personal and limited. I was thinking of something larger and more
      important. Do you give me leave to develop the idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire away, sir,&rdquo; said Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardman nodded his assent. &ldquo;I should like very much to hear in what
      possible way you connect the misconduct of Germany, which I admit, with
      your idea of the present value of classical study, which I question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this way,&rdquo; said the professor earnestly. &ldquo;Germany has been living for
      fifty years with a closed mind. Oh, I grant you it was an active mind,
      scientific, laborious, immensely patient. But it was an ingrowing mind.
      Sure of its own superiority, it took no counsel with antiquity and scorned
      the advice of its neighbors. It was intent on producing something entirely
      new and all its own&mdash;a purely German <i>Kultur</i>, independent of
      the past, and irresponsible to any laws except those of Germany's
      interests and needs. Hence it fell into bad habits of thought and feeling,
      got into trouble, and brought infinite trouble upon the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you claim,&rdquo; interrupted Hardman, &ldquo;that this would have been
      prevented by reading the classics? Would that have been the only and
      efficient cure for Germany's disease? Rather a large claim, that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much too large,&rdquo; replied the professor. &ldquo;I did not make it. In the first
      place, it may be that Germany's trouble had gone beyond any cure but the
      knife. In the second place, I regard the intelligent reading of the Bible
      and the vital apprehension of the real spirit of Christianity as the best
      of all cures for mental and moral ills. All that I claim for the classics&mdash;the
      works of the greatest of the Greek and Roman writers&mdash;is that they
      have in them a certain remedial and sanitary quality. They contain noble
      thoughts in noble forms. They show the strength of self-restraint. They
      breathe the air of clearness and candor. They set forth ideals of
      character and conduct which are elevating. They also disclose the weakness
      and the ugliness of things mean and base. They have the broad and generous
      spirit of the true <i>literae humaniores.</i> They reveal the springs of
      civilization and lead us&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   'To the glory that was Greece,
    To the grandeur that was Rome.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Now these are precisely the remedies 'indicated,' as the physicians say,
      for the cure, or at least the mitigation, of the specific bad habits which
      finally caused the madness of Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell us, sir,&rdquo; asked Dick gravely, &ldquo;how you mean us to take that.
      Do you really think it would have done any good to those brutes who
      ravaged Belgium and outraged France to read Tacitus or Virgil or the Greek
      tragedies? They couldn't have done it, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; answered the professor, while Hardman sat staring intently
      into the fire, &ldquo;probably not. But suppose the leaders and guides of
      Germany (her masters, in effect, who moulded and <i>kultured</i> the
      people to serve their nefarious purpose of dominating the world by
      violence), suppose these masters had really known the meaning and felt the
      truth of the Greek tragedies, which unveil reckless arrogance&mdash;<i>Hybris</i>&mdash;as
      the fatal sin, hateful to the gods and doomed to an inevitable Nemesis.
      Might not this truth, filtering through the masters to the people, have
      led them to the abatement of the ruinous pride which sent Germany out to
      subjugate the other nations in 1914? The egregious General von der Goltz
      voiced the insane arrogance which made this war when he said, 'The
      nineteenth century saw a German Empire, the twentieth shall see a German
      world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or suppose the Teutonic teachers and pastors had read with understanding
      and taken to heart the passages of Csesar in which he curtly describes the
      violent and thievish qualities of the ancient Germans&mdash;how they
      spread desolation around them to protect their borders, and encouraged
      their young men in brigandage in order to keep them in practice. Might not
      these plain lessons have been used as a warning to the people of modern
      Germany to discourage their predatory propensities and their habits of
      devastation and to hold them back from their relapse into the <i>Schrecklichkeit</i>
      of savage warfare? George Meredith says a good thing in 'Diana of the
      Crossways': 'Before you can civilize a man, you must first de-barbarize
      him.' That is the trouble with the Germans, especially their leaders and
      masters. They have never gotten rid of their fundamental barbarism, the
      idolatry of might above right.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    They have only put on a varnish of civilization.
    It cracks and peels off in the heat.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take one more illustration. Suppose these German thought-masters and
      war-lords had really understood and assimilated the true greatness of the
      conception of the old Roman Empire as it is shown, let us say, by Virgil.
      You remember that splendid passage in the Sixth Book of the AEneid where
      the Romans are called to remember that it is their mission 'to crown Peace
      with Law, to spare the humbled, and to subdue and tame the proud.' Might
      not sucn a noble doctrine have detached the Germans a little from their
      blind devotion to the Hohenzollern-Hollweg conception of the modern
      pinchbeck German Empire&mdash;a predatory state, greedy to gain new
      territory but incapable of ruling it when gained, scornful of the rights
      of smaller peoples, oppressing them when subjugated, as she has oppressed
      Poland and Schleswig-Holstein and Alsace-Lorraine, a clumsy and
      exterminating tyrant in her own colonies, as she has shown herself in East
      and West Africa? I tell you that a vital perception of what the Roman
      Empire really meant in its palmy days might have been good medicine for
      Germany. It might have taught her to make herself fit for power before
      seeking to grasp it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granted, granted,&rdquo; broke in Hardman, impatiently poking the fire. &ldquo;You
      can't say anything about Germany too severe to suit me. Whatever she
      needed to keep her from committing the criminal blunder of this war, it is
      certain that she did not get it. The blunder was made and the price must
      be paid. But what I say now, as I said at the beginning, is that Latin and
      Greek are dead languages. For us, for the future, for the competitions of
      the modern industrial and social era, the classics are no good. For a few
      ornamental persons a knowledge of them may be a pleasing accomplishment.
      But they are luxuries, not necessaries. They belong to a bygone age. They
      have nothing to tell us about the things we most need to know&mdash;chemistry
      and physics, engineering and intensive agriculture, the discovery of new
      forms and applications of power, the organization of labor and the
      distribution of wealth, the development of mechanical skill and the
      increase of production&mdash;these are the things that we must study. I
      say they are the only things that will count for success in the new
      democracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what <i>you</i> say,&rdquo; replied Professor De Vries dryly. &ldquo;But the
      wisest men of the world have said something very different. No democracy
      ever has survived, or ever will survive, without an aristocracy at the
      heart of it. Not an aristocracy of birth and privilege, but one of worth
      and intelligence; not a band of hereditary lords, but a company of
      well-chosen leaders. Their value will depend not so much upon their
      technical knowledge and skill as upon the breadth of their mind, the
      clearness of their thought, the loftiness of their motives, the balance of
      their judgment, and the strength of their devotion to duty. For the
      cultivation of these things I say&mdash;pardon the apparent contradiction
      of what <i>you</i> said&mdash;I say the study of the classics has been and
      still is of the greatest value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did George Washington know about the classics?&rdquo; Hardman interrupted
      sharply. &ldquo;He was one of your aristocrats of democracy, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; answered the professor blandly, &ldquo;and he knew more about the
      classics than, I fear, you do, my dear Hardman. At all events, he
      understood what was meant when he was called 'the Cincinnatus of the West'&mdash;and
      he lived up to the ideal, otherwise we should have had no American
      Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let us not drop to personalities. What I maintain is that Latin and
      Greek are not dead languages, because they still convey living thoughts.
      The real success of a democracy&mdash;the production of a finer manhood&mdash;depends
      less upon mechanics than upon morale. For that the teachings of the
      classics are excellent. They have a bracing and a steadying quality. They
      instil a sense of order and they inspire a sense of admiration, both of
      which are needed by the people&mdash;especially the plain people&mdash;of
      a sane democracy. The classics are fresher, younger, more vital and
      encouraging than most modern books. They have lessons for us to-day&mdash;believe
      me&mdash;great words for the present crisis and the pressing duty of the
      hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us an example,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;something classic to fit this war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have one at hand,&rdquo; responded the professor promptly. He went to the
      book-shelves and pulled out a small brown volume with a slip of paper in
      it. He opened the book at the marked place. &ldquo;It is from the Eighth Satire
      of Juvenal, beginning at line 79. I will read the Latin first, and
      afterward a little version which I made the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man rolled the lines out in his sonorous voice, almost chanting:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;'Esto bonus miles, tutor bonus, arbiter idem
    Integer; ambiguae si quando citabere testis
    Incertaeque rei, Phalaris licet imperet ut sis
    Falsus et admoto dictet periuria tauro,
    <i>Summum crede nefas, animam praeferre pudori
    Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.'&rdquo;</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to translate, sir,&rdquo; said Dick, copying exactly the professor's
      classroom phrase and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To gratify my nephew,&rdquo; said the professor, nodding and winking at
      Hardman. &ldquo;But, understand, this is not a real translation. It is only a
      paraphrase. Here it is:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Be a good soldier, and a guardian just;
    Likewise an upright judge. Let no one thrust
    You in a dubious cause to testify,
    Through fear of tyrant's vengeance, to a lie.
    Count it a baseness if your soul prefer
    Safety above what Honor asks of her:
    And hold it manly life itself to give,
    Rather than lose the things for which we live.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is not half as good as the Latin. But it gives the meaning. How do you
      like it, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; answered the young man quickly; &ldquo;especially the last lines. They
      are great.&rdquo; He hesitated slightly, and then went on. &ldquo;Perhaps I ought to
      tell you now, sir, that I have signed up and got my papers for the
      training-school at Madison Barracks. I hope you will not be angry with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man put both hands on the lad's shoulders and looked at him with a
      suspicious moisture in his eyes. He swallowed hard a couple of times. You
      could see the big Adam's apple moving up and down in his wrinkled throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, boy, I love you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardman, who was a thoroughly good fellow at heart, held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for you, Dick! But I must be going now. I am putting up at the Ivy.
      Will you walk up with me? I'd like to have a word with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men walked in silence along the shady, moon-flecked streets of the
      tranquil old university town. Then the elder one spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done the right thing, I am sure. That officers' training-school
      is a good place to get a practical education. When you are through, how
      would you like to have a post in the Ordnance Department at Washington? I
      have some influence there and believe I could get you in without
      difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, a lot,&rdquo; answered the lad modestly. &ldquo;You're awfully kind. But, if
      you don't mind my saying so, I think I'd rather have service at the front&mdash;that
      is, if I can qualify for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another long silence before Hardman spoke again, with an
      apparent change of subject:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would tell me what you really think of your uncle's views on
      the classics, you and the other fellows of your age in the university.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick hesitated a moment before he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, personally, you know, I believe what Uncle says is usually about
      right. He has the habit of it. But I allow when he gets on his hobby he
      rides rather hard. Most of the other fellows have given up the classics&mdash;they
      like the modern-language course with sciences better&mdash;perhaps it's
      softer. They say not; but I know the classics are hard enough. I flunked
      out on my Greek exam junior year. So, you see, I'm not a very good judge.
      But, anyhow, wasn't the bit he read us from Juvenal simply fine? And
      didn't he read it well? I've felt that a hundred times, but never knew how
      to say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in the early fall of 1918, more than a year later, that Hardman
      came once more into the familiar library at Calvinton. He had read the
      casualty list of the last week of August and came to condole with his
      friend De Vries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man sat in the twilight of the tranquil book-lined room, leaning
      back in his armchair, with an open letter on the table before him. He gave
      his hand cordially to Hardman and thanked him for his sympathetic words.
      He talked quietly and naturally about Dick, and confessed how much he
      should miss the boy&mdash;as it were, his only son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I am going to be lonely, but I am not forsaken. I
      shall be sad sometimes, but never sorry&mdash;always proud of my boy.
      Would you like to see this letter? It is the last that he wrote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a young, simple letter, full of cheerful joking and personal
      details and words of affection which the shy lad would never have spoken
      face to face. At the end he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear Governor, this is a rough life, and some parts are not easy to
      bear. But I want you to know that I was never happier in all my days. I
      know that we are fighting for a good cause, justice, and freedom, and a
      world made clean from this beastly German militarism. The things that the
      Germans have done to France and Belgium must be stopped, and they must
      never be done again. We want a decent world to live in, and we are going
      to have it, no matter what it costs. Of course I should like to live
      through it all, if I can do it with honor. But a man never can tell what
      is going to happen. And I certainly would rather give up my life than the
      things we are fighting for&mdash;the things you taught me to believe are
      according to the will of God. So good-night for the present, Uncle, and
      sleep well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your loving nephew and son,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;DICK.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Hardman's hand shook a little as he laid the paper on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a beautiful letter,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded the old professor, putting his hand upon it; &ldquo;it is a
      classic; very clear and simple and high-minded. The German Crown Prince
      says our American soldiers do not know what they are fighting for. But
      Richard knew. It was to defend 'the things for which we live' that he
      gladly gave his life.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      THE NEW ERA AND CARRY ON
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Commandant of the Marine Hospital was at his desk, working hard, when
      the door of the room was flung open and the Officer of the Day rushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he exploded, &ldquo;the New Era has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely, Mr. Corker,&rdquo; answered the Commandant. &ldquo;It has been coming
      continually since the world began. But is that any reason why you should
      enter without knocking, and with your coat covered with bread-crumbs and
      cigarette-ashes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Officer of the Day went outside, brushed his coat, knocked at the
      door, and awaited orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Corker,&rdquo; said the Commandant, &ldquo;have the kindness to bring me your
      report on the condition of yesterday's cases, and let me know what
      operations are indicated for to-day. Good morning. Orderly, my compliments
      to the Executive Officer, and I wish to see him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Executive Officer arrived, he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, the New Era&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Mr. Greel, but you understand this Hospital has to carry on as
      required in any kind of an era. How many patients did we receive
      yesterday? Good. Have we enough bedding and provisions? Bad. Attend to it
      immediately, and let me know the result of your efforts to remedy a
      situation which should never have arisen. The Navy cannot be run on hot
      air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the Executive Officer went out he held the door open for the Head Nurse
      to pass in. She was a fine, upstanding creature, tremulous with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Doctor,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I simply must tell you about the New Era. Woman
      Suffrage is going to save the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, Miss Dooby, it certainly needs saving. Meantime how are things
      in the pneumonia ward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two deaths last night, sir, three new cases this morning. Oxygen is
      running short: no beef-tea or milk. Five of my nurses have gone to attend
      conventions of woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slackers,&rdquo; interrupted the Commandant. &ldquo;Put them on report for leaving
      the ship without permission. I shall attend to their cases. Fill their
      places from the volunteer list. Be so good as to send the head steward
      here immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very sorry, Sir,&rdquo; said the steward, &ldquo;but ye see it's just this way.
      The mess-boys was holdin' a New Era mass-meetin', and the cook he forgot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milk and beef-tea!&rdquo; growled the Commandant as if they were swear-words.
      &ldquo;What the devil is this new influenza that has struck the hospital?
      Steward, you will provide what the head nurse requires at once. Orderly,
      my cap, and call Mr. Greel to accompany me on inspection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the galley the fires were out, the ovens cold, the soup-kettles empty,
      and all the cooks, dish-washers, and scrubbers were absorbing the
      eloquence of the third assistant pie-maker, who stood on an empty
      biscuit-box and explained the glories of the one-hour day in the New Era.
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;Ten<i>shun!</i>&rdquo; yelled the Orderly, and the force of habit brought the
      men up, stiff and silent. The Commandant looked around the circle,
      grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what a beautiful sight! What do you think this is&mdash;a
      blooming debating society? Wrong! It's a hospital, with near a thousand
      sick and wounded to take care of. And it's going to be done, see? And
      you're going to help do it, see? No work&mdash;no pay and no food! Neglect
      of orders means extra duty and no liberty&mdash;perhaps a couple of
      twenty-four-hour days in the brig. That's the rule in all eras, see? Now
      get busy, all of you. Chow at twelve as usual. Carry on, men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; they answered cheerily, for they were weary of the third
      assistant pie-maker's brand of talk and felt the pangs of healthy hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the second engineer, out of breath with running, followed by two
      or three helpers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire, captain,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;fire in the fuel-room&mdash;awful blaze&mdash;started
      in the wood box&mdash;cigarette&mdash;we were just settin' round talkin'
      over what we were goin' to do in the New Era, an' the first thing we knew
      it was burnin' like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The New Era,&rdquo; snapped the Commandant, &ldquo;and be damned to it! Sound the
      fire-call. All hands to quarters. Lead along the hose. Follow me,&rdquo; he
      cried, hurrying forward through the gathering smoke, &ldquo;this ship must be
      saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was&mdash;strictly in conformity with the old laws that fire
      burns, water quenches, and every man must do his duty promptly. On these
      ancient principles, and others equally venerable, the hospital carried on
      its good work. But the Commandant made one new rule. It cost five dollars
      to mention the New Era within its walls.

    <h2>
      THE PRIMITIVE AND HIS SANDALS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sick of all this,&rdquo; said the Great Author, sweeping his hand over the
      silver-laden dinner-table. He seemed to include in his gesture the whole
      house and the broad estate surrounding it. &ldquo;It bores me, and I don't
      believe it can be right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife, at the other end of the table, shining in her low-necked dress
      with diamonds on her breast and in her hair, leaned forward anxiously,
      knowing her husband's temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Nicholas,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what do you mean? You have earned all this by
      your work as a writer. You are the greatest man in the country. You are
      entitled to a fine house and a large estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gravely nodded his big head with its flamboyant locks, and lit a fresh
      cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are always right on practical
      affairs. But, you see, this is an artistic affair. My books are realistic
      and radical. They teach the doctrine of the universal level, that no man
      can be above other men. They have made poverty, perhaps not exactly
      popular, but at least romantic. My villains are always rich and my heroes
      poor. The people like this; but it is rather a strain to believe it and
      keep on believing it. If my work is to hold the public it must have
      illustrations&mdash;moving pictures, you know! Something in character!
      Nobody else can do that as well as I can. It will be better than many
      advertisements. I am going to become a virtuous peasant, a son of the
      soil, a primitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife laughed, with a slight nervous tremor in her voice. She knew her
      husband's temperament, to be sure, but she never knew just how far it
      would carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you must be a little crazy, Nicholas,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Alexandra,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;thank you for the temperate
      flattery. Evidently you have heard the old proverb about genius and
      madness. But why not make the compliment complete and say 'absolutely
      crazy'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;because I do not understand just what you propose to
      do. Are you going to impoverish yourself and the whole family? Are you
      thinking of turning over your farms to these stupid peasants who will let
      them go to rack and ruin? Will you give your property to the village
      council who will drink it up in a month? You know how much money Peter
      needs; he is a member of twelve first-class clubs. And Olga's husband is
      not earning much. Are you going to starve your children and grandchildren
      for the sake of an idea of consistency in art?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Great Author was now standing in front of the fireplace, warming
      himself and filling a pipe. The flames behind him made an aureole in his
      extravagant white hair and beard. He smiled and puffed slowly at his pipe.
      At last he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you go too fast and too far. You know I am enthusiastic, but
      have you ever known me to be silly? It would be wrong to make you and the
      children suffer. I have no right to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: I am going to become a virtuous peasant, a son of the soil,
      a primitive}
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded her head emphatically, and a look of comprehension spread over
      her face. &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;suppose that I should make over the
      real estate and farms to you&mdash;you are an excellent manager. And
      suppose that I should put the personal estate, including copyrights, into
      a trust, the income to be paid to you and the children. You would take
      care of me while I became a primitive, wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;you know I would. But think how uncomfortable it
      will be for you. While we are living in luxury, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry about that,&rdquo; he interrupted with a laugh. &ldquo;I shall have all
      the luxury I want: flannel shirts, loose around the neck, instead of these
      infernal stiff collars; velveteen trousers and jacket instead of this
      waiter's uniform; and I shall go barefoot when the weather is suitable&mdash;do
      you understand? Barefoot in the summer grass&mdash;it will be immense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your food,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;how will you manage that on a primitive
      basis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will manage it,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;you know I have always preferred
      beefsteak and onions to any French dish. Champagne does not agree with me.
      I'd rather have a glass of the straight stuff, without any gas in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your sleeping arrangements,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;are you going to leave
      the house? Our bedroom is not exactly primitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear of it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There is a little room beyond your
      bathroom. Put an iron cot in there, with a soft mattress, linen sheets,
      and light blankets. I'll do my morning wash at the pump in the yard, for
      the sake of the picture. When I want a bath you'll leave the door of the
      room open if you are not actually in the tub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicholas,&rdquo; she said, with a Mona Lisa smile, &ldquo;for an author you have a
      very clever way of putting things. But suppose we have guests at the
      house, you can't come to dinner in dirty clothes and with bare feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I shall put on clean flannels, clean
      velveteens, and sandals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sandals,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;sandals for dinner are simply wonderful. Do you
      think I could&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, my dear,&rdquo; said the Great Author firmly. &ldquo;Your present style
      of dress becomes you amazingly. I am the only one who has to do the
      primitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the arrangements were completed. The interviewers who came to the house
      described the Great Author in his loose flannels and velveteens, with bare
      feet, returning from labor in the fields. The moving pictures were full of
      him. But the sandals did not appear. There were no flash-lights permitted
      at the part-primitive dinner-table.

    <h2>
      DIANA AND THE LIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the darkest hour before the dawn, Diana floated away from her Garden
      Tower and came down between the Lions on the Library Steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, she did not know they were Lions. She thought they were Cats,
      and so she was afraid. For she was very lightly clad; and (except in
      Egypt) Cats are terrible to undomesticated goddesses. Diana shivered as
      she strung her bow for defense. She felt that she was divine, but she knew
      that she had cold feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the Library Steps were wet and glistening, for there had been a
      shower after midnight. But now the gibbous moon was giving a silent
      imitation of an arc-light high in the western heaven. Her beams
      silver-plated the weird architecture of the shrines of Commerce which face
      the great Temple dedicated to the Three Muses of New York&mdash;Astor,
      Lenox, and Tilden.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the awful animals guarding the steps the light was florid, like a
      flush of sunburn discovered by the ablution of a warranted complexion
      cream. They were wonderfully pink, and Diana hastened to draw an arrow
      from her quiver, for it seemed to her as if her feline neighbors were
      beginning to glow with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not shoot,&rdquo; said the ruddier one; &ldquo;we are not angry, we are only
      blushing.&rdquo; And he glanced at her costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diana was astonished to hear a masculine voice utter such a modest
      sentiment. But being a woman, she knew that the first word does not count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cats never blush,&rdquo; she answered boldly, &ldquo;no matter how big they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are not Cats,&rdquo; they cried, ramping suddenly like crests on a
      millionaire's note-paper. &ldquo;We are Lions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana smiled at this, for now she felt safe, remembering that when a male
      begins to boast he is not dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Roar a little for me, please,&rdquo; she said, laying down her unconcealed
      weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said the Northern Lion, &ldquo;a city ordinance forbids
      unnecessary noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; interrupted the Southern Lion. &ldquo;Who would not break a law to
      oblige a lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us compromise,&rdquo; said the Northern Lion, &ldquo;and give her our
      reproduction of an automobile horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Southern Lion, &ldquo;we will give her our automatic record of a
      Book-Advertisement; it is louder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Diana trembled, indeed. But she bravely continued smiling, and said:
      &ldquo;Thank you a thousand times for doing it once! And now please tell me what
      kind of Lions you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Literary Lions,&rdquo; was their prompt and unanimous reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she cried, clapping her hands with a charming gesture, &ldquo;how glad I
      am to meet you! I have been in New York more than twenty years and never
      seen any one like you before! Come and sit beside me and talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lions looked at each other rather sheepishly, and glanced up and down
      the street, as if fearing the approach of a city ordinance. But there was
      no one in sight except Diana, so they shook their literary locks into a
      becoming disorder and sat on the steps with her, purring gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If she had been less beautiful they would have resented this. But, as it
      was, they looked sorry, and asked her if she had never read &ldquo;Who's Who in
      America&rdquo;? She shook her head, and admitted that she had not read it all
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said her neighbor on the south, &ldquo;this is rather an offhand <i>soiree,</i>
      and we may as well cut out proper names. But I will put you wise to the
      fact that I am the Magazine Lion. I got away from Roosevelt in Africa. He
      called me 'Mucky,' and I made tracks. Here he cannot hurt me, for they
      will never let that man do anything in good old New York, not even touch a
      Tiger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said her neighbor on the north, &ldquo;I am the Academic Lion, of whom
      you must have heard. My character is noted for its concealed sweetness,
      and my style leaves nothing to be hoped for. I am literally a man of
      letters, for I have seventeen degrees. Usually I look literary-lean and
      nobly dissatisfied, but yesterday I swallowed a British Female Novelist by
      accident, and that accounts for my inartistic air of cheerfulness. I won
      my splendid reputation by telling other Lions how they ought to have done
      their little tricks. But now, tired of that, I have gone into politics.
      This is my first public office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diana was somewhat confused and benumbed by these personally conducted
      biographies, but she was too well-bred not to appear interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lovely,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;to sit between two such Great Personages! I
      wonder what brought poor little Me to such an honor. And, by the way, how
      do you happen to be just here? What is this beautiful building behind you?
      Is it your Palace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a Library,&rdquo; said the Academic Lion, with a superior tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The biggest book-heap in America,&rdquo; said the Magazine Lion in his vivid
      way. &ldquo;We have them all beaten to a finish&mdash;except the old junk-shop
      down in Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget Boston,&rdquo; said the Academic Lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wouldn't?&rdquo; growled the Magazine Lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; asked Diana, with her most engaging and
      sprightly air, &ldquo;that this splendid place is a Library, all full of books,
      and that you are its most prominent figures, its figureheads, so to speak?
      How interesting! I have travelled a great deal&mdash;under the name of
      Pasht or Bast, in Egypt, where the Cats liked me; and under the name of
      Artemis in Greece; and under my own name in Italy. Believe me, I have seen
      all things that the moon shines upon. But I do not remember having seen
      Lions on a Library before. How original! How appropriate! How suggestive!
      But what does it suggest? What are you here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For educational purposes,&rdquo; said the Academic Lion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To catch the eye,&rdquo; said the Magazine Lion, &ldquo;same as head-lines in a
      newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; exclaimed Diana. &ldquo;You are here to keep the people from getting at
      the books? How modern!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark made the Academic Lion look like a Sphinx, as if he knew
      something but did not want to tell. But the Magazine Lion was distinctly
      flattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said he cheerfully, &ldquo;or next door to it. We don't propose
      to keep the people out, only the authors. Why, when this place was
      publicly opened there was not a single author in the exhibit, except John
      Bigelow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not keep him out?&rdquo; asked Diana.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were not on the spot, then,&rdquo; said the Lion. &ldquo;Besides, there are some
      things that even a Lion does not dare to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not understand,&rdquo; said Diana, &ldquo;precisely why authors should be
      kept away from a library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Magazine Lion laughed. &ldquo;Silly little thing!&rdquo; he said, with a
      fascinating tone of virile condescension. &ldquo;An author's business is to
      write books, not to read them. If he reads, he grows intelligent and
      thoughtful and careful about his work. Those old books spoil him for the
      modern market. But if he just goes ahead and writes whatever comes into
      his head, he can do it with a bang, and everybody sits up and pays
      attention. That's the only way to be original. See?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; broke in the Academic Lion, &ldquo;but you go too far, brother.
      Authors should be encouraged to read, but only under critical guidance and
      professorial direction. Otherwise they will not be able to classify the
      books, and tabulate their writers, and know which ones to admire and
      praise. How can you expect a mere author to comprehend the faulty method
      of Shakespeare, or the ethical commonplaceness of Dickens and Thackeray,
      or the vital Ibsenism of Bernard Shaw and the other near-Ibsens, without
      assistance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the other people,&rdquo; asked Diana, &ldquo;what is going to happen to them if
      you let them go in free and browse among the books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are less important,&rdquo; answered the Academic Lion. &ldquo;Besides we expect
      soon to establish a cranial, neurological, and psychopathic examination
      which will determine the subliminal, temperamental needs of every
      applicant. Then we classify the readers in groups, and the books in lists,
      and the whole thing works with automatic precision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am going to make the book-lists!&rdquo; said the Magazine Lion,
      ecstatically wagging his tail, and half-unconsciously putting his paw
      around the lady's waist in a spirit of pure comradeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she gently slipped away, stood up, and gracefully covered a yawn with
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ever so much obliged to you Literary Lions for not eating me,&rdquo; said
      she. &ldquo;Probably I should have disagreed with you even more than your
      conversation has with me. I am quite sleepy. And the moon has almost
      disappeared. I must be going where I can bid it good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Diana rose, with shining limbs, above the housetops, and vanished
      toward her Garden Tower. The Lions looked disconcerted. &ldquo;Old-fashioned,
      Victorian prude!&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;Brazen hussy!&rdquo; said the other. And they
      climbed back on their Pedestals, resuming their supercilious expression.
      There I suppose they will stay, no matter what Diana may think of them.

    <h2>
      THE HERO AND TIN SOLDIERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      On December twenty-fifth, 1918, that little white house in the park was
      certainly the happiest dwelling in Calvinton. It was simply running over
      with Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, there had come to it a most wonderful present, a surprise full of
      tears and laughter. Captain Walter Mayne reached home on Christmas Eve.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while they had thought that he would never come back at all. News
      had been received that he was grievously wounded in France&mdash;shot to
      pieces, in effect, leading his men near Chateau-Thierry. His life hung on
      the ragged edge of those wounds. But his wife Katharine always believed
      that he would pull through. So he did. But he was lacking a leg, his right
      arm was knocked out of commission for the present, and various other <i>souvenirs
      de la grande guerre</i> were inscribed upon his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then word arrived that he was coming on a transport, with other wounded,
      to be patched up in a hospital on Staten Island. So his wife Katharine
      smiled her way through innumerable entanglements of red tape and went to
      nurse him. Then she set her steady hand to pull all the wires necessary to
      get him discharged and sent home. Christmas was in her heart and she would
      not be denied. So it came to pass that the one-legged Hero was in his own
      house on the happy day, and joy was bubbling all around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the old Pastor entered, late in the afternoon, the Christmas-tree was
      twinkling with lights, the children swarming and buzzing all over the
      place, so that he was dazed for a moment. There were Walter's mother and
      his aunt and his sisters-in-law, boys and girls of various sizes, and a
      jubilant and entrancing baby. The Pastor took it all in, and was glad of
      it, but his mind was on the Hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine, who always understood everything, whispered softly: &ldquo;Walter is
      waiting to see you, Doctor. He is in his study, just across the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Waiting?</i> Well, what can a man whose right leg has been cut off
      above the knee, and who has not yet been able to get an artificial one&mdash;what
      can he do but wait?
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was rather dimly lighted; brilliance is not good for the eyes of
      the wounded. Walter was in a long chair in the corner; his face was
      bronzed, drawn and lined a little by suffering; but steady and cheerful as
      ever, with the eager look which had made his students listen to him when
      he talked to them about English literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Walter,&rdquo; said the Pastor, &ldquo;my dear boy, we are so glad to have
      you home with us again. We are very proud of you. You are our Hero.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;it is mighty good to be home again. But there
      is no hero business about it. I only did what all the other Americans who
      went over there did&mdash;fought my&mdash;excuse me, my best, against the
      beastly Germans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your leg,&rdquo; said the Pastor impulsively, &ldquo;it is gone. Aren't you angry
      about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walter was silent for a moment. Then he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think angry is the right word. You remember that story about
      Nathan Hale in the Revolution&mdash;'I only regret that I have but one
      life to give to my country.' Well, I'm glad that I had two legs to give
      for my country, and particularly glad that she only needed one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me a bit about the fighting,&rdquo; said the Pastor, &ldquo;I want to know what
      it was like&mdash;the hero-touch&mdash;you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; said Walter, &ldquo;and certainly not now. Later on I can tell you
      something, perhaps. But this is Christmas Day. And war? Well, Doctor,
      believe me, war is a horrible thing, full of grime and pain, madness,
      agony, hell&mdash;a thing that ought not to be. I have fought alongside of
      the other fellows to put an end to it, and now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door swung open, and Sammy, the eldest son of the house, pranced in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Daddy,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;see what Aunt Emily has sent me for Christmas&mdash;a
      big box of tin soldiers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayne smiled as the little boy carefully laid the box on his knee; but
      there was a shadow of pain in his eyes, and he closed them for a few
      seconds, as if his mind were going back, somewhere, far away. Then he
      spoke, tenderly, but with a grave voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's fine, sonny&mdash;all those tin soldiers. But don't you think they
      ought to belong to me? You have lots of other toys, you know. Would you
      give the soldiers to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child looked up at him, puzzled for a moment; then a flash of
      comprehension passed over his face, and he nodded valiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, Father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;You're the Captain. Keep the soldiers. I'll play
      with the other toys,&rdquo; and he skipped out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayne's look followed him with love. Then he turned to the old Pastor and
      a strange expression came into his face, half whimsical and half grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you do me a favor? Poke up that fire till it
      blazes. That's right. Now lay this box in the hottest part of the flames.
      That's right. It will soon be gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder man did what was asked, with an air of slight bewilderment, as
      one humors the fancies of an invalid. He wondered whether Mayne's fever
      had quite left him. He watched the fire bulging the lid and catching round
      the edges of the box. Then he heard Mayne's voice behind him, speaking
      very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever I find my little boy <i>playing with tin soldiers,</i> I shall
      spank him well. No, that wouldn't be quite fair, would it? But I shall
      tell him why he must not do it, and <i>I shall make him understand that
      it's an impossible thing.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the old Pastor comprehended. There was no touch of fever. The
      one-legged Hero had come home from the wars completely well and sound in
      mind. So the two men sat together in love by the Christmas fire, and saw
      the tin soldiers melt away.

    <h2>
      SALVAGE POINT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Hermanns built their house at the very end of the island, five or six
      miles from the more or less violently rustic &ldquo;summer-cottages&rdquo; which
      adorned the hills and bluffs around the native village of Winterport.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long point running out to the southward at the mouth of the
      great bay, rough and rocky for the most part, with little woods of pointed
      firs on it, some acres of pasture, and a few pockets of fertile soil lying
      between the stony ridges. A yellow farmhouse, with a red barn beside it,
      had nestled for near a hundred years in one of these hollows, buying
      shelter from the winter winds at the cost of an outlook over sea and
      shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a large price to pay. The view from the summit of the little hill a
      few hundred yards away was superb&mdash;a wonder even on that wonderful
      coast of Maine where mountain and sea meet together, forest and flood kiss
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I suppose the old Yankee farmer knew what he wanted when he paid the
      price and snuggled his house in the hollow. I am certain the Hermanns knew
      what they wanted when they bought the whole point and perched their house
      on the very top of the hill, where all the winds of heaven might visit it
      as roughly as they pleased, but where nothing could rob the outlook of its
      ever-changing splendor and mystery, its fluent wonder and abiding charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, the Hermanns knew what they wanted because they had come through
      a lot of trouble. I met them when they were young&mdash;no matter how many
      years ago&mdash;when they were in the thick of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice Mackaye and Will Hermann had the rare luck to fall in love&mdash;a
      very real and great love&mdash;when they were in their early twenties. You
      would think that extraordinary piece of good fortune would have been
      enough to set them up for life, wouldn't you? But no. There was an
      Obstacle. And that Obstacle came very near wrecking them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will Hermann was an artist and the son of an artist. The love of beauty
      ran in his blood. Otherwise he was poor. He earned a decent living by his
      painting, but each year's living depended on each year's work. Hence he
      was in the proletarian class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice Mackaye, on the other hand, belonged to the capitalist class. I say
      &ldquo;belonged,&rdquo; because that is precisely the word to describe her situation.
      Her father was a millionaire sugar-merchant, who lived in an ugly palace
      near Morristown, New Jersey, and was accustomed to have his own way in
      that and other States. He was the Obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a florid, handsome old Scotchman, orthodox in religion, shrewd in
      business, correct in conduct, but with no more sentiment than a hard-shell
      crab, and obstinate as the devil. His fixed idea was that none of his
      daughters should ever be carried off by a fortune-hunter. The two older
      girls apparently escaped this danger by making fairly wealthy matches. But
      Alice&mdash;come away! why should she take up with this impecunious
      painter? He was good-looking and had the gift of the gab, but what was
      that worth? If he would come into the sugar-business, where a place was
      waiting for him, and make good there, it would be all right. Otherwise,
      the affair must be broken off, absolutely, finally, and forever. From this
      you can see that the Obstacle was not bad-hearted, but only pig-headed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, for five or six years things drifted rather miserably along this
      way. Will Hermann was forbidden the house at Morristown. Alice was
      practically a captive; her correspondence was censored. But of course,
      even before Marconi, wireless communication in matters of this kind has
      always been possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble was that the state of affairs between them, while
      conventionally correct, was thoroughly unnatural and full of peril. Alice,
      a very good girl, obedient and tractable, was in danger of becoming a
      recalcitrant and sour old maid. Will, a healthy and normal young man, with
      no bad habits, was in danger of being driven to them by the emptiness and
      exasperation of his mind. The worst of it all was that both of the young
      people were, in accordance with a well-known law of nature, growing older
      with what seemed to them a frightful and unreasonable rapidity. The years
      crawled like snails. But the sum of them rose by leaps and bounds to an
      appalling total. Alice found two grey hairs in her red-gold locks. Will
      had to use glasses for reading fine print at night. From their point of
      view, decrepitude, senility, dotage stared them in the face, while the
      bright voyage of life which they were resolved to make only together, was
      threatened with shipwreck among the shoals of interminable delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this juncture of affairs that they came to me, as fine-looking a
      young couple as ever I saw. They were good, as mortals go; they were loyal
      and upright, they wanted no scandal, no rumpus in the family, no trouble
      or pain for anybody else; but they wanted to belong to each other much
      more than they wanted to belong to any class, artistic, proletarian, or
      capitalist. And they were desperate because of the pertinacity of the
      Obstacle, whom they both respected fully as much as he deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had stated their case, I made my answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I can see, the salvage of your ship of love depends entirely on
      yourselves. Mr. Hermann is not after a fortune, he only wants his girl; is
      that so? {Hermann nodded vigorously.} And Miss Mackaye does not care about
      being supported in the manner of living to which she has been accustomed;
      she only wants to live with the man whom she has chosen; is that so?
      {Alice blushed and nodded.} Well, then, why shouldn't you lay your course
      and sail ahead together? You are both of age, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They smiled at each other. &ldquo;Yes, and a little over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my father!&rdquo; said Alice. &ldquo;You know I honor him, and I can never deny
      his authority over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was the turn of the talk, the critical moment, the point where the
      chosen counsellor had to fall back upon the ultimate reality of his faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are absolutely correct, dear daughter, in your
      feeling toward your father. He has earned his money and has a right to
      dispose of it as he will. But, you know, there is a statute of limitations
      in regard to the authority of parents over the <i>lives</i> of their
      children. You have passed the limitation. What do you want to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be married to Will Hermann,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for better for worse, for
      richer for poorer, I don't care. But I don't want a family quarrel, a
      runaway match, all that horrid newspaper talk.&rdquo; Here she was evidently a
      little excited and on the verge of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; I hastened to reassure her, &ldquo;you can't possibly have a
      runaway match, because there is nothing for you to run away from. There is
      not a single duty in your father's house which you have not fulfilled, and
      of which your sisters can not now relieve you. There is no authority in
      the world which has the right to command the sacrifice of your life to
      another's judgment. There is only one thing that stands in your way, and
      that is your claim on a large inheritance. I understand you are quite
      willing to let that go. You are not even 'running away' from it&mdash;that
      is not the word&mdash;you are ready to <i>jettison</i> it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked puzzled, and murmured; &ldquo;I don't exactly understand what that
      means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To jettison,&rdquo; I said, in that learned and dispassionate manner which is
      sometimes useful in relieving an emotional situation, &ldquo;is a seafaring
      phrase. It means throwing overboard a part or the whole of a cargo in
      order to save the ship. As far as I can see that is the question which is
      up to you and your best friend at the present moment. Are you prepared to
      jettison the claim on a big fortune for the sake of making your voyage of
      life together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other and a kind of radiance spread over their faces.
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; they answered with one voice. &ldquo;But how can the marriage be
      arranged,&rdquo; asked Alice, &ldquo;without a row in the family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very easily,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Both of you are over age, though you don't
      look it. Our good lawyer friend Harrison will help you to get the license.
      Fix your day for the wedding, neither secret nor notorious; invite anybody
      you like, and come to me on the day you have chosen. The arrangements will
      be made. You shall be married, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they came, and I married them, and it was a very good job.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had some years of difficulty and uncertainty during which I caught
      brief glimpses of them now and then, always cheerful and happy together.
      In the course of time the Obstacle, being not at all bad-hearted but only
      pig-headed, probably relented a little, and finally was gathered to his
      fathers, according to the common lot of man. The older sisters behaved
      very well about the inheritance, and Alice was not left portionless. She
      brought three fine boys into the world. The house on Salvage Point was
      built by her and Will together.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was there that I spent a day with them, in the summer of 1918, after
      many years during which we had not met. I was on naval duty, with
      Commander Kidd, of a certain station on the Maine coast. By invitation we
      put in with the motorboat S.P. 297, at Salvage Point. So it was that I met
      my old friends again, and knew what had become of their barque of love
      which I had helped to save from shipwreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house on the peak of the hill was just what it ought to be; not
      aggressively rustic, not obtrusively classic&mdash;white pillars in front
      of it, and a terrace, but nothing dominating&mdash;it had the air of a
      very large and habitable lighthouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extraordinary thing was the arrangement of the grounds. At every point
      one came upon some reminder of salvage. On the glorious August day when I
      was there, shipwreck seemed impossible: the Southern Way which opened to
      the Ocean was dancing with gay waves; the blue mountains of Maine were
      tranquil on the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see,&rdquo; said Will Hermann, &ldquo;this is really rather a dangerous
      point, though it is so beautiful. It is the gateway of the open sea, and
      there are three big ledges across it. A ship that has lost her bearings a
      little, or is driving in through thick weather, easily comes to grief. But
      there is not often a loss of life, only the ship goes to pieces. And we
      save the pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. There was a terrace west of the house, with a balustrade made
      of the taffrail of a wrecked brigantine. The gateway to the garden was the
      door of an old wheel-house. There was a pergola constructed from the
      timbers of a four-masted schooner that had broken up on the third ledge.
      The bow of the sloop <i>Christabel,</i> with the name still painted on it,
      was just outside the garden-gate. Everywhere you saw old anchor-bits, and
      rudder-posts, and knees, all silver-greyed by the weather, and fitted in
      to the <i>decor</i> of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prettiest thing of all was a crow's-nest from a wrecked brigantine,
      perched on the highest point of the hill, and looking out over the
      marvellous panorama of sea and shore, island and mountain. Here we sat,
      after a hearty luncheon with Alice and her three boys and half-a-dozen
      others who were with them in a kind of summer camp-school; and while we
      smoked our pipes, Will Hermann told this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Alice and I have a mania for things that have been salvaged. We
      don't like the idea of the wrecks, of course. But they would happen any
      way, whether we were here or not. And since that is so, we like to live
      here on the point and help save what we can. Sometimes we get a chance to
      do something for the crews of the little ships that come ashore&mdash;hot
      supper and dry clothes and so forth. But the most interesting salvage case
      that we ever had on the point was one in which there was really no wreck
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a bright September afternoon ten years ago&mdash;one of those
      silver-blue days when there is a little quivering haze in the air
      everywhere, but no fog. We were sitting up here and looking out to sea.
      Just beyond the end of Dunker Rock a large motor-boat came in sight
      through the haze. She was about sixty feet long, with a low cabin forward,
      a cockpit aft, and a raised place for the steersman amidship&mdash;a
      good-looking craft, and evidently very speedy. She carried no flag or
      pennant. She came driving on, full tilt, straight toward us. We supposed
      of course she would turn east through the narrow channel to Winterport, or
      sheer off to the west into the Southern Way and go up the bay. But not a
      point did she swerve. Steady on she came, toward the three big ledges that
      lie out there beyond that bit of shingly beach at the end of the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I can't see any helmsman,' said Alice, 'those people must be asleep or
      crazy. Give them a hail through the megaphone. Perhaps you can make them
      hear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I yelled at the top of my lungs, and Alice waved her jersey. We might
      as well have hailed a comet. That boat ran straight for the ledges as if
      she meant to hurdle them. She came near doing it, too. Over the first she
      scraped, as if her heel had hit it. Over the second she shivered, hanging
      there for a second till a wave lifted her. On the third she bumped hard
      and checked her way for a moment, but the engine kept going, and finally
      she got herself over somehow and ran head on to the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we were excited, and everybody hurried down to see what this
      crazy performance meant. There was not a creature on the boat, alive or
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything was shipshape. The little craft had evidently been used for
      fishing. There were rough men's clothes on board, rubber boots and
      oilskins, fresh water and provisions, blankets in the cabin, fishing-lines
      and bait in the cockpit, gasolene in the tanks&mdash;a nice little outfit,
      all complete, and no one to run it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where had she come from? There were no names on bow or stern, no papers
      in the cabin. Who had started her on this crazy voyage? How did she get
      away from them? Had they perhaps abandoned her and cast her adrift for
      some mysterious reason? Undoubtedly there were men&mdash;apparently three&mdash;on
      board when she set out. What had happened to them? A drunken quarrel? Or
      possibly one of the men had fallen overboard; the others had jumped in to
      save him; the engine had started up and the boat left them all in the
      lurch. Perhaps one or all of them may have had some reason for wanting to
      'disappear without a trace,' so they hit upon the plan of going ashore at
      some lonely place and turning the boat loose to wreck herself. That would
      have been a stupid scheme of course, but not too stupid to be human.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just a little piece of sea mystery to which we had no clew. So we
      debated it for an hour, and then set about the more important work of
      salvaging the stranded derelict. Fortunately she went ashore near the last
      of the ebb, and now lay comfortably in the mud, apparently little damaged
      except for some long scratches on her side, and a broken blade in her
      propeller. We dug away the mud at bow and stern, made fast a tow-line, and
      when the tide came in my small cruiser pulled her off easily. In the
      morning the mysterious stranger lay at anchor in the cove round the
      corner, as quiet as a China duck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we advertised in the coast newspapers, giving a description of
      the boat&mdash;'came ashore,' etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three days later a boy about thirteen years old turned up at Winterport.
      He came from a village at the northeast corner of the bay forty miles
      away. He guessed the boat was his father's, but couldn't say for sure
      until he had seen it. So he came down to the point and identified it
      beyond a doubt. He told his story very simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boat belonged to his father, who was a widow-man with only one child.
      He used the boat for fishing, and sometimes he took Johnny with him,
      sometimes not. On the trips without the boy he used to stay out longer,
      sometimes a week or ten days. About a week ago he had started out on one
      of these trips with two other men. They had a dory in tow. They hadn't
      come back. Johnny had seen the piece in the paper. Here was the boat, for
      sure, but no dory. As for the rest of the story&mdash;well, that was all
      that Johnny had to tell us about it&mdash;the mystery was as far away as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a fine, sturdy little chap, with tanned face and clear blue eyes.
      He was rather shaken by his experience, of course, but he wouldn't cry&mdash;not
      for the world. We were glad to take him in for the night, while we
      verified his story by telegraph. It seemed the boat was practically his
      only inheritance, and the first question he asked, after we had gone over
      it, was how much we wanted him to pay for salvage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Just one cent,' said Alice, taking the words out of my mouth, 'and what
      is more, we are going to have her repaired for you. She isn't much hurt.'
      So the boy stammered out the best kind of a 'thank you' that he could
      manage, and the look in his eyes made up for the lack of words. That was
      the time that he came nearest to crying. But Alice saved him by asking
      what he was going to do with the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had an idea that he could run her himself, perhaps with another man to
      help him, for fishing in the fall, and for pleasure parties in the summer.
      He didn't want to cut loose from home altogether and sell the boat.
      Perhaps Dad might come back, some day, or send a letter. Anyway Johnny
      wanted to stay by a seafaring life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we arranged the repairs and all that, and got a man to help on the
      homeward trip, and after a few days Johnny sailed off with his patrimony.
      That is what Alice and I consider our neatest job of salvage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did it work all right?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finely,&rdquo; said Will Hermann, &ldquo;like a charm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is the lad now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bo'sun's mate on a certain destroyer somewhere off the coast of France,
      fighting in the U. S. Navee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the father?&rdquo; I inquired, being one of those old-fashioned persons who
      like all the loose ends of a story to be tied up. &ldquo;Was anything ever heard
      of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; answered my friend, carefully shaking out the ashes of his pipe
      beyond the crow's-nest rail, &ldquo;that belongs in a different compartment of
      the ship.&rdquo;

      THE BOY OF NAZARETH DREAMS
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a Boy in Nazareth long ago whose after-life was wonderful, and
      whose story is written in the heart of mankind. His birth was predicted in
      dreams foretelling marvellous things of him, and in later years there were
      many true visions wherein he played a wondrous part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he not also dream, in the days of his youth, while he was growing in
      wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man? It would be strange
      indeed if his boyhood was not often visited and illumined by those swift
      flashes of insight and clear unveilings of hidden things, which we call
      dreams but which are in truth rays from &ldquo;the fountain light of all our
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first journey that he made, his earliest visit to a great city, the
      three days and nights when he was lost there&mdash;surely these were times
      when visions must have come to him, full of mystery and wonder, yet
      clothed in the simple, real forms of this world, which he was learning to
      know. So I let my revery follow him on that unrecorded path, remembering
      where it led him, and imagining, in the form of dreams, what may have met
      him on his way.

    <h2>
      I. THE JOURNEY TO THE CITY
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was not a lad in the country town of Nazareth, nestled high on the
      bosom of the Galilean hills, who did not often look eagerly southward over
      the plain toward the dark mountains of Samaria, and think of the great
      city which lay beyond them, and long for the time when he would be old
      enough to go with his family on pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      That journey would carry him out of childhood. It would mark the beginning
      of his life as a &ldquo;son of the commandment,&rdquo; a member of the Hebrew nation.
      Moreover it would be an adventure&mdash;a very great and joyous adventure,
      which youth loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palestine, in the days when Augustus Caesar was Lord of the World, was an
      exciting country to travel in. It was full of rovers and soldiers of
      fortune from many lands. It was troubled by mobs and tumults and
      rebellions, infested with landlopers and brigands. Jerusalem itself was
      not only a great city, it was a boisterous and boiling city, crowded with
      visitors from all parts of the world, merchants and travellers, princes
      and beggars, citizens of Rome and children of the Desert. There were
      strange sights to be seen there, and all kinds of things were sold in the
      markets. So while the heart of young Nazareth longed for it, the heart of
      older Nazareth was not without anxieties and apprehensions in regard to
      the first pilgrimage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was doubly true in the home of the Boy of whom I speak. He was the
      first-born, the darling of his parents, a lad beloved by all who knew him.
      His mother hung on him with mystical joy and hope. He was the apple of her
      eye. Deep in her soul she kept the memory of angelic words which had come
      to her while she carried him under her heart&mdash;words which made her
      believe that her son would be the morning-star of Israel and a light unto
      the Gentiles. So she cherished the Boy and watched over him with tender,
      unfailing care, as her most precious possession, her living, breathing,
      growing treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the age of twelve, he was old enough to go up to the
      Temple and take part in the national feast of the Passover. So she clad
      him in the garments of youth and made him ready for the four days'
      pilgrimage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a camping-trip, a wonder-walk, full of variety, with a spice of
      danger and a feast of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boy was the joy of the journey. His keen interest in all things seen
      and heard was like a refreshing spring of water to the older pilgrims.
      They had so often travelled the same road that they had forgotten that it
      might be new every morning. His unwearying vigor and gladness as he ran
      down the hillsides, or scrambled among the rocks far above the path, or
      roamed through the fields filling his hands with flowers, was like a merry
      song that cheered the long miles of the way. He was glad to be alive, and
      it made the others glad to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were sixty or seventy kinsfolk and neighbors, plain rustic men and
      women, in the little company that set out from Nazareth. The men carried
      arms to protect the caravan from robbers or marauders. As they wound
      slowly down the steep, stony road to the plain of Esdraelon the Boy ran
      ahead, making short cuts, turning aside to find a partridge's nest among
      the bushes, jumping from rock to rock like a young gazelle, or poising on
      the edge of some cliff in sheer delight of his own sure-footedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His body was outlined against the sky; his blue eyes (like those of his
      mother, who was a maid of Bethlehem) sparkled with the joy of living; his
      long hair was lifted and tossed by the wind of April. But his mother's
      look followed him anxiously, and her heart often leaped in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; she said, as they took their noon-meal in the valley at the foot
      of dark Mount Gilboa, &ldquo;you must be more careful. Your feet might slip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; answered the Boy, &ldquo;I am truly very careful. I always put my feet
      in the places that God has made for them&mdash;on the big, strong rocks
      that will not roll. It is only because I am so happy that you think I am
      careless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tents were pitched, the first night, under the walls of Bethshan, a
      fortified city of the Romans. Set on a knoll above the river Jordan, the
      town loomed big and threatening over the little camp of the Galilean
      pilgrims. But they kept aloof from it, because it was a city of the
      heathen. Its theatres and temples and palaces were accursed. The tents
      were indifferent to the city, and when the night opened its star-fields
      above them and the heavenly lights rose over the mountains of Moab and
      Samaria, the Boy's clear voice joined in the slumber-song of the pilgrims:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;I will lift up mine eyes to the hilis,
  From whence cometh my help;
  My help cometh from the Lord,
  Who made heaven and earth.
  He will not suffer thy foot to stumble,
  He who keepeth thee will not slumber.
  Behold, He who guardeth Israel
  Will neither slumber nor sleep.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then they drew their woollen cloaks over their heads and rested on the
      ground in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days their way led through the wide valley of the Jordan, along
      the level land that stretched from the mountains on either side to the
      rough gulch where the river was raging through its jungle. They passed
      through broad fields of ripe barley and ripening wheat, where the quail
      scuttled and piped among the thick-growing stalks. There were
      fruit-orchards and olive-groves on the foothills, and clear streams ran
      murmuring down through glistening oleander thickets. Wild flowers sprang
      in every untilled corner; tall spikes of hollyhocks, scarlet and blue
      anemones, clusters of mignonette, rock-roses, and cyclamens, purple iris
      in the moist places, and many-colored spathes of gladiolus growing
      plentifully among the wheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The larks sang themselves into the sky in the early morn. Hotter grew the
      sun and heavier the air in that long trough below the level of the sea.
      The song of birds melted away. Only the hawks wheeled on motionless wings
      above silent fields, watching for the young quail or the little rabbits,
      hidden among the grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrims plodded on in the heat. Companies of soldiers with glittering
      arms, merchants with laden mules jingling their bells, groups of ragged
      thieves and bold beggars met and jostled the peaceful travellers on the
      road. Once a little band of robbers, riding across the valley to the land
      of Moab, turned from a distance toward the Nazarenes, circled swiftly
      around them like hawks, whistling and calling shrilly to one another. But
      there was small booty in that country caravan, and the men who guarded it
      looked strong and tough; so the robbers whirled away as swiftly as they
      had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boy had stood close to his father in this moment of danger, looking on
      with surprise at the actions of the horsemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did those riders want?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All we have,&rdquo; answered the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is very little,&rdquo; said the Boy. &ldquo;Nothing but our clothes and some
      food for our journey. If they were hungry, why did they not ask of us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed. &ldquo;These are not the kind that ask,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are the
      kind that take&mdash;what they will and when they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like them,&rdquo; said the Boy. &ldquo;Their horses were beautiful, but
      their faces were hateful&mdash;like a jackal that I saw&mdash;in the
      gulley behind Nazareth one night. His eyes were burning red as fire. Those
      men had fires inside of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of that afternoon he walked more quietly and with thoughtful
      looks, as if he were pondering the case of men who looked like jackals and
      had flames within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunset, when the camp was made outside the gates of the new city of
      Archelaus, on a hillock among the corn-fields, he came to his mother with
      his hands full of the long lavender and rose and pale-blue spathes of the
      gladiolus-lilies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, mother,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;are they not fine&mdash;like the clothes of a
      king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know of kings?&rdquo; she answered, smiling. &ldquo;These are only wild
      lilies of the field. But a great king, like Solomon, has robes of thick
      silk, and jewels on his neck and his fingers, and a big crown of gold on
      his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that must be very heavy,&rdquo; said the Boy, tossing his head lightly. &ldquo;It
      must tire him to wear a crown-thing and such thick robes. Besides, I think
      the lilies are really prettier. They look just as if they were glad to
      grow in the field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The third night they camped among the palm-groves and heavy-odored gardens
      of Jericho, where Herod's splendid palace rose above the trees. The fourth
      day they climbed the wild, steep, robber-haunted road from the Jordan
      valley to the highlands of Judea, and so came at sundown to their
      camp-ground among friends and neighbors on the closely tented slope of the
      Mount of Olives, over against Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an evening that was for the Boy! His first sight of the holy city,
      the city of the great king, the city lifted up and exalted on the sides of
      the north, beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth! He had
      dreamed of her glory as he listened at his mother's knee to the
      wonder-tales of David and Solomon and the brave adventures of the fighting
      Maccabees. He had prayed for the peace of Jerusalem every night as he
      kneeled by his bed and lifted his hands toward the holy place. He had
      tried a thousand times to picture her strength and her splendor, her
      marvels and mysteries, her multitude of houses and her vast bulwarks, as
      he strayed among the humble cottages of Nazareth or sat in the low doorway
      of his own home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now his dream had come true. He looked into the face of Jerusalem, just
      across the deep, narrow valley of the Kidron, where the shadows of the
      evening were rising among the tombs. The huge battlemented walls,
      encircling the double mounts of Zion and Moriah&mdash;the vast huddle of
      white houses, covering hill and hollow with their flat roofs and standing
      so close together that the streets were hidden among them&mdash;the
      towers, the colonnades, the terraces&mdash;the dark bulk of the Roman
      castle&mdash;the marble pillars and glittering roof of the Temple in its
      broad court on the hilltop&mdash;it was a city of stone and ivory and
      gold, rising clear against the soft saffron and rose and violet of the
      sunset sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boy sat with his mother on the hillside while the light waned, and the
      lamps began to twinkle in the city, the stars to glow in the deepening
      blue. He questioned her eagerly&mdash;what is that black tower?&mdash;why
      does the big roof shine so bright?&mdash;where was King David's house?&mdash;where
      are we going to-morrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;you will see. But now it is the sleep-time.
      Let us sing the psalm that we used to sing at night in Nazareth&mdash;but
      very softly, not to disturb the others&mdash;for you know this psalm is
      not one of the songs of the pilgrimage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the mother and her Child sang together with low voices:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;In peace will I both lay me down and sleep,
    For thou, Lord, makest me dwell in safety.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The tune and the words quieted the Boy. It was like a bit of home in a far
      land.

    <h2>
      II. THE GILDED TEMPLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day was full of wonder and excitement. It was the first day of
      the Feast, and the myriad of pilgrims crowded through the gates and
      streets of the city, all straining toward the enclosure of the Temple,
      within whose walls two hundred thousand people could be gathered. On every
      side the Boy saw new and strange things: soldiers in their armor, and
      shops full of costly wares; richly dressed Sadducees with their servants
      following; Jews from far-away countries, and curious visitors from all
      parts of the world; ragged children of the city, and painted women of the
      street, and beggars and outcasts of the lower quarters, and rich ladies
      with their retinues, and priests in their snowy robes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family from Nazareth passed slowly through the confusion, and the Boy,
      bewildered by the changing scene, longed to get to the Temple. He thought
      everything must be quiet and holy there. But when they came into the
      immense outer court, with its porticos and alcoves, he found the confusion
      worse than ever. For there the money-changers and the buyers and sellers
      of animals for sacrifice were bargaining and haggling; and the thousands
      of people were jostling and pushing one another; and the followers of the
      Pharisees and the Sadducees were disputing; and on many faces he saw that
      strange look which speaks of a fire in the heart, so that it seemed like a
      meeting-place of robbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father had bought a lamb for the Passover sacrifice, at one of the
      stalls in the outer court, and was carrying it on his shoulder. He pressed
      on through the crowd at the Beautiful Gate, the Boy and his mother
      following until they came to the Court of the Women. Here the mother
      stayed, for that was the law&mdash;a woman must not go farther. But the
      Boy was now &ldquo;a son of the Commandment,&rdquo; and he followed his father through
      the Court of Israel to the entrance of the Court of the Priests. There the
      little lamb was given to a priest, who carried it away to the great stone
      altar in the middle of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boy could not see what happened then, for the place was crowded and
      busy. But he heard the blowing of trumpets, and the clashing of cymbals,
      and the chanting of psalms. Black clouds of smoke went up from the hidden
      altar; the floor around was splashed and streaked with red. After a long
      while, as it seemed, the priest brought back the dead body of the lamb,
      prepared for the Passover supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this our little lamb?&rdquo; asked the Boy as his father took it again upon
      his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a very pretty one,&rdquo; said the Boy. &ldquo;Did it have to die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father looked down at him curiously. &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it had to be
      offered on the altar, so that we can keep our feast according to the law
      of Moses to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why,&rdquo; persisted the Boy, &ldquo;must all the lambs be killed in the Temple?
      Does God like that? How many do you suppose were brought to the altar
      to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tens of thousands,&rdquo; answered the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great many,&rdquo; said the Boy, sighing. &ldquo;I wish one was enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent and thoughtful as they made their way through the Court of
      the Women and found the mother and went back to the camp on the hillside.
      That night the family ate their Paschal feast, with their loins girded as
      if they were going on a journey, in memory of the long-ago flight of the
      Israelites from Egypt. There was the roasted lamb, with bitter herbs, and
      flat cakes of bread made without yeast. A cup of wine was passed around
      the table four times. The Boy asked his father the meaning of all these
      things, and the father repeated the story of the saving of the first-born
      sons of Israel in that far-off night of terror and death when they came
      out of Egypt. While the supper was going on, hymns were sung, and when it
      was ended they all chanted together:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good;
    For His loving-kindness endureth for ever.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So the Boy lay down under his striped woollen cloak of blue and white and
      drifted toward sleep, glad that he was a son of Israel, but sorry when he
      thought of the thousands of little lambs and the altar floor splashed with
      red. He wondered if some day God would not give them another way to keep
      that feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day of the festival was a Sabbath, on which no work could be
      done. But the daily sacrifice of the Temple, and all the services and
      songs and benedictions in its courts, continued as usual, and there was a
      greater crowd than ever within its walls. As the Boy went thither with his
      parents they came to a place where a little house was beginning to burn,
      set on fire by an overturned lamp. The poor people stood by, wringing
      their hands and watching the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do they not try to save their house?&rdquo; cried the Boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father shook his head. &ldquo;They can do nothing,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;They
      follow the teaching of the Pharisees, who say that it is unlawful to put
      out a fire on the Sabbath, because it is a labor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later the Boy saw a cripple with a crutch, sitting in the door of
      a cottage, looking very sad and lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he not go with the others,&rdquo; asked the Boy, &ldquo;and hear the music
      at the Temple? That would make him happier. Can't he walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the father, &ldquo;he can hop along pretty well with his crutch
      on other days, but not on the Sabbath, for he would have to carry his
      crutch, and that would be labor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the time he was in the Temple, watching the procession of priests and
      Levites and listening to the music, the Boy was thinking what the Sabbath
      meant, and whether it really rested people and made them happier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third day of the festival was the offering of the first-fruits of the
      new year's harvest. That was a joyous day. A sheaf of ripe barley was
      reaped and carried into the Temple and presented before the high altar
      with incense and music. The priests blessed the people, and the people
      shouted and sang for gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boy's heart bounded in his breast as he joined in the song and thought
      of the bright summer begun, and the birds building their nests, and the
      flowers clothing the hills with beautiful colors, and the wide fields of
      golden grain waving in the wind. He was happy all day as he walked through
      the busy streets with his parents, buying some things that were needed for
      the home in Nazareth; and he was happy at night when he lay down under an
      olive-tree beside the tent, for the air was warm and gentle, and he fell
      asleep under the tree, dreaming of what he would see and do to-morrow.

    <h2>
      III. HOW THE BOY WAS LOST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now comes the secret of the way he was lost&mdash;a way so simple that the
      wonder is that no one has ever dreamed of it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three important days of the Passover were ended, and the time had come
      when those pilgrims who wished to return to their homes might leave
      Jerusalem without offense, though it was more commendable to remain
      through the full seven days. The people from Nazareth were anxious to be
      gone&mdash;they had a long road to travel&mdash;their harvests were
      waiting. While the Boy, tired out, was sleeping under the tree, the
      question of going home was talked out and decided. They would break camp
      at sunrise, and, joining with others of their countrymen who were tented
      around them, they would take the road for Galilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Boy awoke earlier than any one else the next morning. Before the
      dawn a linnet in the tree overhead called him with twittering songs. He
      was rested by his long sleep. His breath came lightly. The spirit of youth
      was beating in his limbs, His heart was eager for adventure. He longed for
      the top of a high hill&mdash;for the wide, blue sky&mdash;for the world at
      his feet&mdash;such a sight as he had often found in his rambles among the
      heights near Nazareth. Why not? He would return in time for the next visit
      to the Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly he stepped among the sleeping-tents in the dark. A footpath led
      through the shadowy olive-grove, up the hillside, into the open. There the
      light was clearer, and the breeze that runs before the daybreak was
      dancing through the grass. The Boy turned to the left, following along one
      of the sheep-trails that crossed the high, sloping pastures. Then he bore
      to the right, breasting the long ridge, and passed the summit, running
      lightly to the eastward until he came to a rounded, rocky knoll. There he
      sat down among the little bushes to wait for sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far beyond the wrinkled wilderness of Tekoa, and the Dead Sea, and the
      mountain-wall of Moab, the rim of the sky was already tinged with silvery
      gray. The fading of the stars travelled slowly upward, and the brightening
      of the rose of dawn followed it, until all the east was softly glowing and
      the deep blue of the central heaven was transfused with turquoise light.
      Dark in the gulfs and chasms of the furrowed land the night lingered.
      Bright along the eastern peaks and ridges the coming day, still hidden,
      revealed itself in a fringe of dazzling gold, like the crest of a long
      mounting wave. Shoots and flashes of radiance sprang upward from the
      glittering edge. Streamers of rose-foam and gold-spray floated in the sky.
      Then over the barrier of the hills the sun surged royally-crescent,
      half-disk, full-orb&mdash;and overlooked the world. The luminous tide
      flooded the gray villages of Bethany and Bethphage, and all the emerald
      hills around Bethlehem were bathed in light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boy sat entranced, watching the miracle by which God makes His sun to
      shine upon the good and the evil. How strange it was that God should do
      that&mdash;bestow an equal light upon those who obeyed Him and those who
      broke His law! Yet it was splendid, it was King-like to give in that way,
      with both hands. No, it was Father-like&mdash;and that was what the Boy
      had learned from his mother&mdash;that God who made and ruled all things
      was his Father. It was the name she had taught him to use in his prayers.
      Not in the great prayers he learned from the book&mdash;the name there was
      Adonai, the Lord, the Almighty. But in the little prayers that he said by
      himself it was &ldquo;my Father!&rdquo; It made the Boy feel strangely happy and
      strong to say that. The whole world seemed to breathe and glow around him
      with an invisible presence. For such a Father, for the sake of His love
      and favor, the Boy felt he could do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than that, his mother had told him of something special that the
      Father had for him to do in the world. In the evenings during the journey
      and when they were going home together from the Temple, she had repeated
      to him some of the words that the angel-voices had spoken to her heart,
      and some of the sayings of wise men from the East who came to visit him
      when he was a baby. She could not understand all the mystery of it; she
      did not see how it was going to be brought to pass. He was a child of
      poverty and lowliness; not rich, nor learned, nor powerful. But with God
      all things were possible. The choosing and calling of the eternal Father
      were more than everything else. It was fixed in her heart that somehow her
      Boy was sent to do a great work for Israel. He was the son of God set
      apart to save his people and bring back the glory of Zion. He was to
      fulfil the promises made in olden time and bring in the wonderful reign of
      the Messiah in the world&mdash;perhaps as a forerunner and messenger of
      the great King, or perhaps himself&mdash;ah, she did not know! But she
      believed in her Boy with her whole soul; and she was sure that his Father
      would show him what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      These sayings, coming amid the excitements of his first journey, his visit
      to the Temple, his earliest sight of the splendor and confusion and misery
      of the great city, had sunken all the more deeply into the Boy's mind.
      Excitement does not blur the impressions of youth; it sharpens them, makes
      them more vivid. Half-covered and hardly noticed at the time, they spring
      up into life when the quiet hour comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Boy remembered his mother's words while he lay watching the
      sunrise. It would be great to make them come true. To help everybody to
      feel what he felt there on the hilltop&mdash;that big, free feeling of
      peace and confidence and not being afraid! To make those robbers in the
      Jordan valley see how they were breaking the rule of the world and burning
      out their own hearts! To cleanse the Temple from the things that filled it
      with confusion and pain, and drive away the brawling buyers and sellers
      who were spoiling his Father's great house! To go among those poor and
      wretched and sorrowful folks who swarmed in Jerusalem and teach them that
      God was their Father too, and that they must not sin and quarrel any more!
      To find a better way than the priests' and the Pharisees' of making people
      good! To do great things for Israel&mdash;like Moses, like Joshua, like
      David&mdash;or like Daniel, perhaps, who prayed and was not afraid of the
      lions&mdash;or like Elijah and Elisha, who went about speaking to the
      people and healing them&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft tread of bare feet among the bushes behind him roused the Boy. He
      sprang up and saw a man with a stern face and long hair and beard looking
      at him mysteriously. The man was dressed in white, with a leathern girdle
      round his waist, into which a towel was thrust. A leathern wallet hung
      from his neck, and he leaned upon a long staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace be with you, Rabbi,&rdquo; said the Boy, reverently bowing at the
      stranger's feet. But the man looked at him steadily and did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boy was confused by the silence. The man's eyes troubled him with
      their secret look, but he was not afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, sir,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;and what is your will with me? Perhaps you
      are a master of the Pharisees or a scribe? But no&mdash;there are no broad
      blue fringes on your garments. Are you a priest, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head, frowning. &ldquo;I despise the priests,&rdquo; he answered,
      &ldquo;and I abhor their bloody and unclean sacrifices. I am Enoch the Essene, a
      holy one, a perfect keeper of the law. I live with those who have never
      defiled themselves with the eating of meat, nor with marriage, nor with
      wine; but we have all things in common, and we are baptized in pure water
      every day for the purifying of our wretched bodies, and after that we eat
      the daily feast of love in the kingdom of the Messiah which is at hand.
      Thou art called into that kingdom, son; come with me, for thou art
      called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boy listened with astonishment. Some of the things that the man said&mdash;for
      instance, about the sacrifices and about the nearness of the kingdom&mdash;were
      already in his heart. But other things puzzled and bewildered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother says that I am called,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but it is to serve Israel
      and to help the people. Where do you live, sir, and what is it that you do
      for the people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We live among the hills of that wilderness,&rdquo; he answered, pointing to the
      south, &ldquo;in the oasis of Engedi. There are palm-trees and springs of water,
      and we keep ourselves pure, bathing before we eat and offering our food of
      bread and dates as a sacrifice to God. We all work together, and none of
      us has anything that he calls his own. We do not go up to the Temple nor
      enter the synagogues. We have forsaken the uncleanness of the world and
      all the impure ways of men. Our only care is to keep ourselves from
      defilement. If we touch anything that is forbidden we wash our hands and
      wipe them with this towel that hangs from our girdle. We alone are serving
      the kingdom. Come, live with us, for I think thou art chosen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boy thought for a while before he answered. &ldquo;Some of it is good, my
      master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the rest of it is far away from my thoughts. Is
      there nothing for a man to do in the world but to think of himself&mdash;either
      in feasting and uncleanness as the heathen do, or in fasting and purifying
      yourself as you do? How can you serve the kingdom if you turn away from
      the people? They do not see you or hear you. You are separate from them&mdash;just
      as if you were dead without dying. You can do nothing for them. No, I do
      not want to come with you and live at Engedi. I think my Father will show
      me something better to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Father!&rdquo; said Enoch the Essene. &ldquo;Who is He?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; answered the Boy, &ldquo;He is the same as yours. He that made us and
      made all that we see&mdash;the great world for us to live in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dust,&rdquo; said the man, with a darker frown&mdash;&ldquo;dust and ashes! It will
      all perish, and thou with it. Thou art not chosen&mdash;not pure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he went away down the hill; and the Boy, surprised and grieved
      at his rude parting, wondered a little over the meaning of his words, and
      then went back as quickly as he could toward the tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to the olive-grove they were gone! The sun was already high,
      and his people had departed hours ago. In the hurry and bustle of breaking
      camp each of the parents had supposed that the Boy was with the other, or
      with some of the friends and neighbors, or perhaps running along the
      hillside above them as he used to do. So they went their way cheerfully,
      not knowing that they had left their son behind. This is how it came to
      pass that he was lost.

      IV. HOW THE BOY WENT HIS WAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the Boy saw what had happened he was surprised and troubled, but not
      frightened. He did not know what to do. He might hasten after them, but he
      could not tell which way to go. He was not even sure that they had gone
      home; for they had talked of paying a visit to their relatives in the
      south before returning to Nazareth; and some of the remaining pilgrims to
      whom he turned for news of his people said that they had taken the
      southern road from the Mount of Olives, going toward Bethlehem.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boy was at a loss, but he was not disheartened, nor even cast down. He
      felt that somehow all would be well with him; he would be taken care of.
      They would come back for him in good time. Meanwhile there were kind
      people here who would give him food and shelter. There were boys in the
      other camps with whom he could play. Best of all, he could go again to the
      city and the Temple. He could see more of the wonderful things there, and
      watch the way the people lived, and find out why so many of them seemed
      sad or angry, and a few proud and scornful, and almost all looked
      unsatisfied. Perhaps he could listen to some of the famous rabbis who
      taught the people in the courts of the Temple and learn from them about
      the things which his Father had chosen him to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went down the hill and toward the Sheep Gate by which he had always
      gone into the city. Outside the gate a few boys about his own age, with a
      group of younger children, were playing games.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there,&rdquo; they cried&mdash;&ldquo;a stranger! Let us have some fun with him.
      Halloo, Country, where do you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Galilee,&rdquo; answered the Boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Galilee is where all the fools live,&rdquo; cried the children. &ldquo;Where is your
      home? What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told them pleasantly, but they laughed at his country way of speaking
      and mimicked his pronunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yalilean! Yalilean!&rdquo; they cried. &ldquo;You can't task. Can you play? Come and
      play with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they played together. First, they had a mimic wedding-procession. Then
      they made believe that the bridegroom was killed by a robber, and they had
      a mock funeral. The Boy took always the lowest part. He was the hired
      mourner who followed the body, wailing; he was the flute-player who made
      music for the wedding-guests to dance to.
    </p>
    <p>
      So readily did he enter into the play that the children at first were
      pleased with him. But they were not long contented with anything. Some of
      them would dance no more for the wedding; others would lament no more for
      the funeral. Their caprices made them quarrelsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yalilean fool,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;you play it all wrong. You spoil the game.
      We are tired of it. Can you run? Can you throw stones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they ran races; and the Boy, trained among the hills, outran the
      others. But they said he did not keep to the course. Then they threw
      stones; and the Boy threw farther and straighter than any of the rest.
      This made them angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whispering together, they suddenly hurled a shower of stones at him. One
      struck his shoulder, another made a long cut on his cheek. Wiping away the
      blood with his sleeve, he turned silently and ran to the Sheep Gate, the
      other boys chasing him with loud shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He darted lightly through the crowd of animals and people that thronged
      the gateway, turning and dodging with a sure foot among them and running
      up the narrow street that led to the sheep-market. The cries of his
      pursuers grew fainter behind him. Among the stalls of the market he wound
      this way and that way like a hare before the hounds. At last he had left
      them out of sight and hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he ceased running and wandered blindly on through the northern
      quarter of the city. The sloping streets were lined with bazaars and noisy
      workshops. The Roman soldiers from the castle were sauntering to and fro.
      Women in rich attire, with ear-rings and gold chains, passed by with their
      slaves. Open market-places were still busy, though the afternoon trade was
      slackening.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Boy was too tired and faint with hunger and heavy at heart to take
      an interest in these things. He turned back toward the gate, and, missing
      his way a little, came to a great pool of water, walled in wit, white
      stone, with five porticos around it. In some of these porticos there were
      a few people lying upon mats. But one of the porches was empty, and here
      the Boy sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was worn out. His cheek was bleeding again, and the drops trickled down
      his neck. He went down the broad steps to the pool to wash away the blood.
      But he could not do it very well. His head ached too much. So he crept
      back to the porch, unwound his little turban, curled himself in a corner
      on the hard stones, his head upon his arm, and fell sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was awakened by a voice calling him, a hand laid upon his shoulder. He
      looked up and saw the face of a young woman, dark-eyed, red-lipped, only a
      few years older than himself. She was clad in silk, with a veil of gauze
      over her head, gold coins in her hair, and a phial of alabaster hanging by
      a gold chain around her neck. A sweet perfume like the breath of roses
      came from it as she moved. Her voice was soft and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are wounded; some one has hurt you. What are
      you doing here? You look like a little brother that I had long ago. Come
      with me. I will take care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boy rose and tried to go with her. But he was stiff and sore; he could
      hardly walk; his head was swimming. The young woman beckoned to a Nubian
      slave who followed her. He took the Boy in his big black arms and so
      carried him to a pleasant house with a garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were couches and cushions there, in a marble court around a
      fountain. There were servants who brought towels and ointments. The young
      woman bathed the Boy's wound and his feet. The servants came with food,
      and she made him eat of the best. His eyes grew bright again, and the
      color came into his cheeks. He talked to her of his life in Nazareth, of
      the adventures of his first journey, and of the way he came to be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened to him intently, as if there were some strange charm in his
      simple talk. Her eyes rested upon him with pleasure. A new look swept over
      her face. She leaned close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay with me, boy,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;for I want you. Your people are gone.
      You shall sleep here to-night&mdash;you shall live with me and I will be
      good to you&mdash;I will teach you to love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boy moved back a little and looked at her with wide eyes, as if she
      were saying something that he could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have already been good to me, sister,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and I love
      you already, even as your brother did. Is your husband here? Will he come
      soon, so that we can all say the prayer of thanks-giving together for the
      food?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her look changed again; her eyes filled with pain and sorrow; she shrank
      back and turned away her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no husband,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ah, boy, innocent boy, you do not
      understand. I eat the bread of shame and live in the house of wickedness.
      I am a sinner, a sinner of the city. How could I pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that she fell a-sobbing, rocking herself to and fro, and the tears
      ran through her fingers like rain. The Boy looked at her, astonished and
      pitiful. He moved nearer to her, after a moment, and spoke softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry, sister,&rdquo; he said; and as he spoke he felt her tears
      falling on his feet. &ldquo;I am more sorry than I ever was in my life. It must
      be dreadful to be a sinner. But sinners can pray, for God is our Father,
      and fathers know how to forgive. I will stay with you and teach you some
      of the things my mother has taught me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up and caught his hand and kissed it. She wiped away her tears,
      and rose, pushing back her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear little master,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you shall not stay in this house&mdash;not
      an hour. It is not fit for you. My Nubian shall lead you back to the gate,
      and you will return to your friends outside of the city, and you will
      forget one whom you comforted for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boy turned back as he stood in the doorway. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will not
      forget you. I will always remember your love and kindness. Will you learn
      to pray, and give up being a sinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will try,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;you have made me want to try. Go in peace.
      God knows what will become of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, sister,&rdquo; replied the Boy gravely. &ldquo;Abide in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he went out into the dusk with the Nubian and found the camp on the
      hillside and a shelter in one of the friendly tents, where he slept
      soundly and woke refreshed in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This day he would not spend in playing and wandering. He would go straight
      to the Temple, to find some of the learned teachers who gave instruction
      there, and learn from them the wisdom that he needed in order to do his
      work for his Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went he thought about the things that had befallen him yesterday.
      Why had the man dressed in white despised him? Why had the city children
      mocked him and chased him away with stones? Why was the strange woman who
      had been so kind to him afterward so unhappy and so hopeless?
    </p>
    <p>
      There must be something in the world that he did not understand, something
      evil and hateful and miserable that he had never felt in himself. But he
      felt it in the others, and it made him so sorry, so distressed for them,
      that it seemed like a heavy weight, a burden on his own heart. It was like
      the work of those demons, of whom his mother had told him, who entered
      into people and lived inside of them, like worms eating away a fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only these people of whom he was thinking did not seem to have a demon
      that took hold of them and drove them mad and made them foam at the mouth
      and cut themselves with stones, like a man he once saw in Galilee. This
      was something larger and more mysterious-like the hot wind that sometimes
      blew from the south and made people gloomy and angry&mdash;like the rank
      weeds that grew in certain fields, and if the sheep fed there they dropped
      and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boy felt that he hated this unknown, wicked, unhappy thing more than
      anything else in the world. He would like to save people from it. He
      wanted to fight against it, to drive it away. It seemed as if there were a
      spirit in his heart saying to him, &ldquo;This is what you must do, you must
      fight against this evil, you must drive out the darkness, you must be a
      light, you must save the people&mdash;this is your Father's work for you
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But how? He did not know. That was what he wanted to find out. And he went
      into the Temple hoping that the teachers there would tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the vast Court of the Gentiles, as it had been on his first
      visit, swarming with people. Jews and Syrians and foreigners of many
      nations were streaming into it through the eight open gates, meeting and
      mingling and eddying round in confused currents, bargaining and haggling
      with the merchants and money-changers, crowding together around some group
      where argument had risen to a violent dispute, drifting away again in
      search of some new excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning sacrifice was ended, but the sound of music floated out from
      the enclosed courts in front of the altar, where the more devout
      worshippers were gathered. The Roman soldiers of the guard paced up and
      down, or leaned tranquilly upoa their spears, looking with indifference or
      amused contempt upon the turbulent scenes of the holy place where they
      were set to keep the peace and prevent the worshippers from attacking one
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boy turned into the long, cool cloisters, their lofty marble columns
      and carved roofs, which ran around the inside of the walls. Here he found
      many groups of people, walking in the broad aisles between the pillars, or
      seated in the alcoves of Solomon's Porch around the teachers who were
      instructing them. From one to another of these open schools he wandered,
      listening eagerly to the different rabbis and doctors of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here one was reading from the Torah and explaining the laws about the food
      which a Jew must not eat, and the things which he must not do on the
      Sabbath. Here another was expounding the doctrine of the Pharisees about
      the purifying of the sacred vessels in the Temple; while another, a
      Sadducee, was disputing with him scornfully and claiming that the
      purification of the priests was the only important thing. &ldquo;You would wash
      that which needs no washing,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the Golden Candlestick, one day
      in every week! Next you will want to wash the sun for fear an unclean ray
      of light may fall on the altar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Other teachers were reciting from the six books of the Talmud which the
      Pharisees were making to expound the law. Others repeated the histories of
      Israel, recounted the brave deeds of the Maccabees, or read from the
      prophecies of Enoch and Daniel. Others still were engaged in political
      debate: the Zealots talking fiercely of the misdeeds of the house of Herod
      and the outrages committed by the Romans; the Sadducees contemptuously
      mocking at the hopes of the revolutionists and showing that the dream of
      freedom for Judea was foolish. &ldquo;Freedom,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;belongs to those who
      are well protected. We have the Temple and priesthood because Rome takes
      care of us.&rdquo; To this the Zealots answered angrily: &ldquo;Yes, the priesthood
      belongs to you unbelieving Sadducees; that is why you are content with it.
      Look, now, at the place where you let Herod hang an accursed eagle of gold
      on the front of Jehovah's House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So from group to group the Boy passed, listening intently, but hearing
      little to his purpose. All day long he listened, now to one, now to
      another, completely absorbed by what he heard, yet not satisfied. Late in
      the afternoon he came into the quietest part of Solomon's Porch, where two
      large companies were seated around their respective teachers, separated
      from each other by a distance of four or five columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood on the edge of the first company, whose rabbi was a lean,
      dark-bearded, stern little man, the Boy was spoken to by a stranger at his
      side, who asked him what he sought in the Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wisdom,&rdquo; answered the Boy. &ldquo;I am looking for some one to give a light to
      my path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I am seeking, too,&rdquo; said the stranger, smiling. &ldquo;I am a
      Greek, and I desire wisdom. Let us see if we can get it from this teacher.
      Listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made his way to the centre of the circle and stood before the stern
      little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said the Greek, &ldquo;I am willing to become thy disciple if thou
      wilt teach me the whole law while I stand before thee thus&mdash;on one
      foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rabbi looked at him angrily, and, lifting up his stick, smote him
      sharply across the leg. &ldquo;That is the whole law for mockers,&rdquo; he cried. The
      stranger limped away amid the laughter of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the little man was too angry; he did not see that I was in earnest,&rdquo;
       said he, as he came back to the Boy. &ldquo;Now let us go to the next school and
      see if the master there is any better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went to the second company, which was gathered around a very old
      man, with long, snowy beard and a gentle face. The stranger took his place
      as before, standing on one foot, and made the same request. The rabbi's
      eyes twinkled and his lips were smiling as he answered promptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do nothing to thy neighbor that thou wouldst not have him do to thee,
      this is the whole law; all the rest follows from this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the stranger, returning, &ldquo;what think you of this teacher and
      his wisdom? Is it better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is far better,&rdquo; replied the Boy eagerly: &ldquo;it is the best of all I have
      heard to-day. I am coming back to hear him to-morrow. Do you know his
      name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is Hillel,&rdquo; answered the Greek, &ldquo;and he is a learned man, the
      master of the Sanhedrim. You will do well, young Jew, to listen to such a
      man. Socrates could not have answered me better. But now the sun is near
      setting. We must go our ways. Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the tent of his friends the Boy found welcome and a supper, but no news
      of his parents. He told his experiences in the Temple, and the friends
      heard him, wondering at his discernment. They were in doubt whether to let
      him go again the next day; but he begged so earnestly, arguing that they
      could tell his parents where he was if they should come to the camp
      seeking him, that finally he won consent.

    <h2>
      V. HOW THE BOY WAS FOUND
    </h2>
    <p>
      He was in Solomon's Porch long before the schools had begun to assemble.
      He paced up and down under the triple colonnade, thinking what questions
      he should ask the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company that gathered around Hillel that day was smaller, but there
      were more scribes and doctors of the law among them, and they were
      speaking of the kingdom of the Messiah&mdash;the thing that lay nearest to
      the Boy's heart. He took his place in the midst of them, and they made
      room for him, for they liked young disciples and encouraged them to ask
      after knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the prophecy of Daniel that they were discussing, and the question
      was whether these things were written of the First Messiah or of the
      Second Messiah; for many of the doctors held that there must be two, and
      that the first would die in battle, but the second would put down all his
      enemies and rule over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; asked the Boy, &ldquo;if the first was really the Messiah, could not
      God raise him up again and send him back to rule?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ask wisely, son,&rdquo; answered Hillel, &ldquo;and I think the prophets tell us
      that we must hope for only one Messiah. This book of Daniel is full of
      heavenly words, but it is not counted among the prophets whose writings
      are gathered in the Scripture. Which of them have you read, and which do
      you love most, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isaiah,&rdquo; said the Boy, &ldquo;because he says God will have mercy with
      everlasting-kindness. But I love Daniel, too, because he says they that
      turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars for ever and ever. But
      I do not understand what he says about the times and a half-time and the
      days and the seasons before the coming of Messiah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this there rose a dispute among the doctors about the meaning of
      those sayings, and some explained them one way and some another, but
      Hillel sat silent. At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better to hope and to wait patiently for Him than to reckon the day
      of His coming. For if the reckoning is wrong, and He does not come, then
      men despair, and no longer make ready for Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does a man make ready for Him, Rabbi?&rdquo; asked the Boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By prayer, son, and by study of the law, and by good works, and by
      sacrifices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when He comes He will rule over the whole world, and how can all the
      world come to the Temple to sacrifice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A way will be provided,&rdquo; answered the old man, &ldquo;though I do not know how
      it will be. And there are offerings of the heart as well as of the altar.
      It is written, 'I will have mercy and not sacrifice.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will His kingdom be for the poor as well as for the rich, and for the
      ignorant as well as for the wise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      {Illustration: From a painting by Holman Junt. The Finding of Christ in
      The Temple}
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it will be for the poor and for the rich alike. But it will not be
      for the ignorant, my son. For he who does not know the law cannot be
      pious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Rabbi,&rdquo; said the Boy eagerly, &ldquo;will He not have mercy on them just
      because they are ignorant? Will He not pity them as a shepherd pities his
      sheep when they are silly and go astray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not only a Shepherd,&rdquo; answered Hillel firmly, &ldquo;but a great King.
      They must all keep the law, even as it is written and as the elders have
      taught it to us. There is no other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boy was silent for a time, while the others talked of the law, and of
      the Torah, and of the Talmud in which Hillel in those days was writing
      down the traditions of the elders. When there was an opportunity he spoke
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rabbi, if most of the people should be both poor and ignorant when the
      Messiah came, so ignorant that they did not even know Him, wouldn't He
      save them just because they were poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hillel looked at the Boy with love, and hesitated before he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a man and a woman came through the colonnade with hurried
      steps. The man stopped at the edge of the circle, astonished at what he
      saw. But the woman came into the centre and put her arm around the Boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;why hast thou done this to us? See how sorrowful
      thou hast made me and thy father, looking everywhere for thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;why did you look everywhere for me with sorrow?
      Did you not know that I would be in my Father's house? Must I not begin to
      think of the things my Father wants me to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the lost Boy was found again, and went home with, his parents to
      Nazareth. The old rabbi blessed him as he left the Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      But had he really been lost, or was he finding his way?
    </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
